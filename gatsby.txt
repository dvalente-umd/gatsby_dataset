In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just
remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages
that you've had."

He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative
in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more
than that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments,
a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also
made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind
is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it
appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I
was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the
secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were
unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile
levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate
revelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations
of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are
usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving
judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of
missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,
and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is
parcelled out unequally at birth.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission
that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet
marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.
When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the
world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I
wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the
human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was
exempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I
have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of
successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related
to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that
flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
"creative temperament"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic
readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it
is not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right
at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the
wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the
abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.


My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western
city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we
have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the
actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in
fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale
hardware business that my father carries on today.

I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with
special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in
Father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a
century after my father, and a little later I participated in that
delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the
counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being
the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the
ragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond
business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it
could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it
over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said,
"Why--ye-es" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance
me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I
thought, in the spring of twenty-two.

The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm
season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,
so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house
together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found
the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but
at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out
to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days
until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed
and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the
electric stove.

It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently
arrived than I, stopped me on the road.

"How do you get to West Egg village?" he asked helplessly.

I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a
pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the
freedom of the neighborhood.

And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the
trees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar
conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be
pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen
volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood
on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to
unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas
knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.
I was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very
solemn and obvious editorials for the "Yale News"--and now I was going
to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most
limited of all specialists, the "well-rounded man." This isn't just an
epigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window,
after all.

It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of
the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender
riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where
there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of
land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most
domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great
wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the
egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact
end--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more
arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except
shape and size.

I lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though
this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little
sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the
egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge
places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on
my right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual
imitation of some HÃ´tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,
spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool
and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.
Or rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by
a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a
small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the
water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling
proximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg
glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins
on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom
Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom
in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in
Chicago.

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of
the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a
national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute
limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of
anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his
freedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago
and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for
instance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.
It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy
enough to do that.

Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no
particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever
people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move,
said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight
into Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking
a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable
football game.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East
Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was
even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian
Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach
and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over
sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached
the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the
momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows,
glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy
afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his
legs apart on the front porch.

He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired
man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.
Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and
gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not
even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous
power of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he
strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle
shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body
capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.

His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of
fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in
it, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had
hated his guts.

"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final," he seemed to
say, "just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are." We
were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I
always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like
him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

"I've got a nice place here," he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.

Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the
front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half
acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped
the tide off shore.

"It belonged to Demaine the oil man." He turned me around again,
politely and abruptly. "We'll go inside."

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space,
fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.
The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass
outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze
blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other
like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of
the ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a
shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch
on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored
balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and
fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight
around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the
whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.
Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught
wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two
young women ballooned slowly to the floor.

The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length
at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised
a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely
to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of
it--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having
disturbed her by coming in.

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly
forward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd,
charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the
room.

"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness."

She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand
for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one
in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had.
She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.
(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people
lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)

At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object
she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something
of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any
exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low,
thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and
down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be
played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement
in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:
a singing compulsion, a whispered "Listen," a promise that she had done
gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
exciting things hovering in the next hour.

I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east
and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.

"Do they miss me?" she cried ecstatically.

"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel
painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all
night along the North Shore."

"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!" Then she added
irrelevantly, "You ought to see the baby."

"I'd like to."

"She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?"

"Never."

"Well, you ought to see her. She's----"

Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped
and rested his hand on my shoulder.

"What you doing, Nick?"

"I'm a bond man."

"Who with?"

I told him.

"Never heard of them," he remarked decisively.

This annoyed me.

"You will," I answered shortly. "You will if you stay in the East."

"Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry," he said, glancing at
Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.
"I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else."

At this point Miss Baker said "Absolutely!" with such suddenness that I
started--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.
Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and
with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.

"I'm stiff," she complained, "I've been lying on that sofa for as long
as I can remember."

"Don't look at me," Daisy retorted. "I've been trying to get you to New
York all afternoon."

"No, thanks," said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the
pantry, "I'm absolutely in training."

Her host looked at her incredulously.

"You are!" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of
a glass. "How you ever get anything done is beyond me."

I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she "got done." I enjoyed
looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect
carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the
shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at
me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented
face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,
somewhere before.

"You live in West Egg," she remarked contemptuously. "I know somebody
there."

"I don't know a single----"

"You must know Gatsby."

"Gatsby?" demanded Daisy. "What Gatsby?"

Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;
wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled
me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.

Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two
young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the
sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished
wind.

"Why CANDLES?" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her
fingers. "In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year."
She looked at us all radiantly. "Do you always watch for the longest day
of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the
year and then miss it."

"We ought to plan something," yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the
table as if she were getting into bed.

"All right," said Daisy. "What'll we plan?" She turned to me helplessly.
"What do people plan?"

Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her
little finger.

"Look!" she complained. "I hurt it."

We all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.

"You did it, Tom," she said accusingly. "I know you didn't mean to
but you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man,
a great big hulking physical specimen of a----"

"I hate that word hulking," objected Tom crossly, "even in kidding."

"Hulking," insisted Daisy.

Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool
as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all
desire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a
polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew
that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too
would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the
West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its
close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer
nervous dread of the moment itself.

"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," I confessed on my second glass
of corky but rather impressive claret. "Can't you talk about crops or
something?"

I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an
unexpected way.

"Civilization's going to pieces," broke out Tom violently.
"I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read
'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?"

"Why, no," I answered, rather surprised by his tone.

"Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if
we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged.
It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved."

"Tom's getting very profound," said Daisy with an expression of
unthoughtful sadness. "He reads deep books with long words in them.
What was that word we----"

"Well, these books are all scientific," insisted Tom, glancing at her
impatiently. "This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us
who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have
control of things."

"We've got to beat them down," whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
toward the fervent sun.

"You ought to live in California--" began Miss Baker but Tom
interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.

"This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are
and----" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
slight nod and she winked at me again. "--and we've produced all the
things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that.
Do you see?"

There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency,
more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost
immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy
seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.

"I'll tell you a family secret," she whispered enthusiastically. "It's
about the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?"

"That's why I came over tonight."

"Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for
some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.
He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to
affect his nose----"

"Things went from bad to worse," suggested Miss Baker.

"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up
his position."

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon
her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as
I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with
lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.

The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear
whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went
inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned
forward again, her voice glowing and singing.

"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an
absolute rose. Doesn't he?" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.
"An absolute rose?"

This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only
extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her
heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those
breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the
table and excused herself and went into the house.

Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of
meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said "Sh!" in
a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room
beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The
murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted
excitedly, and then ceased altogether.

"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----" I said.

"Don't talk. I want to hear what happens."

"Is something happening?" I inquired innocently.

"You mean to say you don't know?" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.
"I thought everybody knew."

"I don't."

"Why----" she said hesitantly, "Tom's got some woman in New York."

"Got some woman?" I repeated blankly.

Miss Baker nodded.

"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't
you think?"

Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of
a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back
at the table.

"It couldn't be helped!" cried Daisy with tense gayety.

She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and
continued: "I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic
outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale
come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----" her
voice sang "----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?"

"Very romantic," he said, and then miserably to me: "If it's light enough
after dinner I want to take you down to the stables."

The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her
head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all
subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the
last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again,
pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every
one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom
were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have
mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth
guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament
the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to
telephone immediately for the police.

The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss
Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into
the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while
trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed
Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In
its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.

Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and
her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent
emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some
sedative questions about her little girl.

"We don't know each other very well, Nick," she said suddenly.
"Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding."

"I wasn't back from the war."

"That's true." She hesitated. "Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick,
and I'm pretty cynical about everything."

Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more,
and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her
daughter.

"I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything."

"Oh, yes." She looked at me absently. "Listen, Nick; let me tell you what
I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?"

"Very much."

"It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less
than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether
with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it
was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head
away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope
she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world,
a beautiful little fool."

"You see I think everything's terrible anyhow," she went on in a
convinced way. "Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW.
I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything."
Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she
laughed with thrilling scorn. "Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!"

The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention,
my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.
It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick
of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited,
and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk
on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather
distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.


Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker
sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from
the "Saturday Evening Post"--the words, murmurous and
uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light,
bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair,
glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender
muscles in her arms.

When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

"To be continued," she said, tossing the magazine on the table, "in our
very next issue."

Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she
stood up.

"Ten o'clock," she remarked, apparently finding the time on the
ceiling. "Time for this good girl to go to bed."

"Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow," explained Daisy,
"over at Westchester."

"Oh,--you're JORdan Baker."

I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous
expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of
the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I
had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story,
but what it was I had forgotten long ago.

"Good night," she said softly. "Wake me at eight, won't you."

"If you'll get up."

"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon."

"Of course you will," confirmed Daisy. "In fact I think I'll arrange
a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you
together. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push
you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----"

"Good night," called Miss Baker from the stairs. "I haven't heard a word."

"She's a nice girl," said Tom after a moment. "They oughtn't to let her
run around the country this way."

"Who oughtn't to?" inquired Daisy coldly.

"Her family."

"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's
going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of
week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very
good for her."

Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.

"Is she from New York?" I asked quickly.

"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our
beautiful white----"

"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?"
demanded Tom suddenly.

"Did I?" She looked at me. "I can't seem to remember, but I think
we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of
crept up on us and first thing you know----"

"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick," he advised me.

I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later
I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by
side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy
peremptorily called "Wait!

"I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were
engaged to a girl out West."

"That's right," corroborated Tom kindly. "We heard that you were
engaged."

"It's libel. I'm too poor."

"But we heard it," insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in
a flower-like way. "We heard it from three people so it must be true."

Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely
engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the
reasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on
account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being
rumored into marriage.

Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely
rich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove
away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of
the house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions
in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he "had some woman in New York"
was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.
Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his
sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.

Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside
garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I
reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for
a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown
off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and
a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the
frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the
moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not
alone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my
neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets
regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely
movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested
that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was
his of our local heavens.

I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and
that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave
a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his
arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him
I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and
distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,
that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby
he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.

About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily
joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to
shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of
ashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and
hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and
chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of
men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives
out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey
men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud
which screens their obscure operations from your sight.

But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift
endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.
J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and
gigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but,
instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a
nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to
fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself
into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes,
dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over
the solemn dumping ground.

The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and
when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on
waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an
hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was
because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.

The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His
acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular
restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about,
chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I
had no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on
the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped
to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the
car.

"We're getting off!" he insisted. "I want you to meet my girl."

I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to
have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that
on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.

I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked
back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent
stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick
sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street
ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the
three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night
restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a
garage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed
Tom inside.

The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the
dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had
occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that
sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the
proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands
on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and
faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his
light blue eyes.

"Hello, Wilson, old man," said Tom, slapping him jovially on the
shoulder. "How's business?"

"I can't complain," answered Wilson unconvincingly. "When are you going
to sell me that car?"

"Next week; I've got my man working on it now."

"Works pretty slow, don't he?"

"No, he doesn't," said Tom coldly. "And if you feel that way about it,
maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all."

"I don't mean that," explained Wilson quickly. "I just meant----"

His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then
I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a
woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle
thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously
as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue
crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an
immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body
were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her
husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in
the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her
husband in a soft, coarse voice:

"Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down."

"Oh, sure," agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office,
mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen
dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in
the vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.

"I want to see you," said Tom intently. "Get on the next train."

"All right."

"I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level."

She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson
emerged with two chairs from his office door.

We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before
the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting
torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.

"Terrible place, isn't it," said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor
Eckleburg.

"Awful."

"It does her good to get away."

"Doesn't her husband object?"

"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb
he doesn't know he's alive."

So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not
quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom
deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be
on the train.

She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched
tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in
New York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of "Town Tattle" and a
moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream
and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive
she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one,
lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the
mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she
turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the
front glass.

"I want to get one of those dogs," she said earnestly. "I want to get one
for the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog."

We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John
D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very
recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.

"What kind are they?" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the
taxi-window.

"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?"

"I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that
kind?"

The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew
one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.

"That's no police dog," said Tom.

"No, it's not exactly a polICE dog," said the man with disappointment
in his voice. "It's more of an airedale." He passed his hand over the
brown wash-rag of a back. "Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog
that'll never bother you with catching cold."

"I think it's cute," said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. "How much is it?"

"That dog?" He looked at it admiringly. "That dog will cost you ten
dollars."

The airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere
though its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down
into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with
rapture.

"Is it a boy or a girl?" she asked delicately.

"That dog? That dog's a boy."

"It's a bitch," said Tom decisively. "Here's your money. Go and buy ten
more dogs with it."

We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the
summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great
flock of white sheep turn the corner.

"Hold on," I said, "I have to leave you here."

"No, you don't," interposed Tom quickly. "Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't 
come up to the apartment. Won't you,
Myrtle?"

"Come on," she urged. "I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to
be very beautiful by people who ought to know."

"Well, I'd like to, but----"

We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.
At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of
apartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the
neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases
and went haughtily in.

"I'm going to have the McKees come up," she announced as we rose in the
elevator. "And of course I got to call up my sister, too."

The apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small
dining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to
the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it
so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of
ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was
an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred
rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself
into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down
into the room. Several old copies of "Town Tattle "lay on the table
together with a copy of "Simon Called Peter" and some of the small
scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with
the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and
some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large
hard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer
of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey
from a locked bureau door.

I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that
afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it
although until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful
sun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the
telephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at
the drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so
I sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of "Simon
Called Peter"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted
things because it didn't make any sense to me.

Just as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called
each other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive
at the apartment door.

The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty
with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky
white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more
rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the
old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about
there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets
jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary
haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered
if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated
my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.

Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just
shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he
was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He
informed me that he was in the "artistic game" and I gathered later
that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.
Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife
was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride
that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times
since they had been married.

Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now
attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which
gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.
With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a
change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage
was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her
assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she
expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be
revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.

"My dear," she told her sister in a high mincing shout, "most of these
fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a
woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the
bill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out."

"What was the name of the woman?" asked Mrs. McKee.

"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own
homes."

"I like your dress," remarked Mrs. McKee, "I think it's adorable."

Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.

"It's just a crazy old thing," she said. "I just slip it on sometimes when
I don't care what I look like."

"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean," pursued
Mrs. McKee. "If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could
make something of it."

We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from
over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee
regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand
back and forth slowly in front of his face.

"I should change the light," he said after a moment. "I'd like to bring
out the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the
back hair."

"I wouldn't think of changing the light," cried Mrs. McKee. "I think
it's----"

Her husband said "SH!" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon
Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.

"You McKees have something to drink," he said. "Get some more ice and
mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep."

"I told that boy about the ice." Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair
at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. "These people! You have to keep
after them all the time."

She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the
dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that
a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.

"I've done some nice things out on Long Island," asserted Mr. McKee.

Tom looked at him blankly.

"Two of them we have framed downstairs."

"Two what?" demanded Tom.

"Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the
other I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' "

The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.

"Do you live down on Long Island, too?" she inquired.

"I live at West Egg."

"Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named
Gatsby's. Do you know him?"

"I live next door to him."

"Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's
where all his money comes from."

"Really?"

She nodded.

"I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me."

This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by
Mrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:

"Chester, I think you could do something with HER," she broke out,
but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention
to Tom.

"I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All
I ask is that they should give me a start."

"Ask Myrtle," said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as
Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. "She'll give you a letter of
introduction, won't you, Myrtle?"

"Do what?" she asked, startled.

"You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can
do some studies of him." His lips moved silently for a moment as he
invented. " 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like
that."


Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: "Neither of them
can stand the person they're married to."

"Can't they?"

"Can't STAND them." She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. "What I say is,
why go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get
a divorce and get married to each other right away."

"Doesn't she like Wilson either?"

The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard
the question and it was violent and obscene.

"You see?" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.
"It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and
they don't believe in divorce."

Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness
of the lie.

"When they do get married," continued Catherine, "they're going west to
live for a while until it blows over."

"It'd be more discreet to go to Europe."

"Oh, do you like Europe?" she exclaimed surprisingly. "I just got back
from Monte Carlo."

"Really."

"Just last year. I went over there with another girl."

"Stay long?"

"No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles.
We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped
out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time
getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!"

The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue
honey of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me
back into the room.

"I almost made a mistake, too," she declared vigorously. "I almost
married a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was
below me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below
you!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure."

"Yes, but listen," said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,
"at least you didn't marry him."

"I know I didn't."

"Well, I married him," said Myrtle, ambiguously. "And that's the
difference between your case and mine."

"Why did you, Myrtle?" demanded Catherine. "Nobody forced you to."

Myrtle considered.

"I married him because I thought he was a gentleman," she said finally.
"I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick
my shoe."

"You were crazy about him for a while," said Catherine.

"Crazy about him!" cried Myrtle incredulously. "Who said I was crazy about
him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man
there."

She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.
I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.

"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a
mistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never
even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.
She looked around to see who was listening: " 'Oh, is that your suit?' I 
said.
'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I 
lay down
and cried to beat the band all afternoon."

"She really ought to get away from him," resumed Catherine to me.
"They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the
first sweetie she ever had."

The bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all
present, excepting Catherine who "felt just as good on nothing at all."
Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches,
which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk
eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried
to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me
back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of
yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the
casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and
wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled
by the inexhaustible variety of life.

Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath
poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.

"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the
last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my
sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather
shoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at
me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.
When we came into the station he was next to me and his white
shirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call
a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into
a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway
train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live
forever, you can't live forever.' "

She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial
laughter.

"My dear," she cried, "I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm
through with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to
make a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave
and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where
you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's
grave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't
forget all the things I got to do."

It was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch
and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists
clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my
handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried
lather that had worried me all the afternoon.

The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through
the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared,
reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other,
searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time
toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face
discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to
mention Daisy's name.

"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!" shouted Mrs. Wilson. "I'll say it whenever I want
to! Daisy! Dai----"

Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his
open hand.

Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's
voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of
pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.
When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his
wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and
there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the
despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread
a copy of "Town Tattle" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.
Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from
the chandelier I followed.

"Come to lunch some day," he suggested, as we groaned down in the
elevator.

"Where?"

"Anywhere."

"Keep your hands off the lever," snapped the elevator boy.

"I beg your pardon," said Mr. McKee with dignity, "I didn't know I was
touching it."

"All right," I agreed, "I'll be glad to."

. . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the
sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.

"Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . .
Brook'n Bridge . . . ."

Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania
Station, staring at the morning "Tribune" and waiting for the four
o'clock train.

There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In
his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the
whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the
afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or
taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of
foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties
to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past
midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to
meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra
gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers
and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.

Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer
in New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back
door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the
kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an
hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's
thumb.

At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several
hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas
tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with
glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of
harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.
In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked
with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of
his female guests were too young to know one from another.

By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair
but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and
cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have
come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from
New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and
salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in
strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The
bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the
garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and
casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and
enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.

The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and
now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of
voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute,
spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups
change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the
same breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave
here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,
joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph
glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the
constantly changing light.

Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out
of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like
Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the
orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a
burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda
Gray's understudy from the "Follies." The party has begun.

I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of
the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not
invited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out
to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there
they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they
conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with
amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby
at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own
ticket of admission.

I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg
blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly
formal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it
said, if I would attend his "little party" that night. He had
seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before
but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed
Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand.

Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after
seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies
of people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed
on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young
Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry
and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous
Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or
insurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the
easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few
words in the right key.

As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or
three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an
amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements
that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place
in the garden where a single man could linger without looking
purposeless and alone.

I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when
Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble
steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest
down into the garden.

Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone
before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.

"Hello!" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally
loud across the garden.

"I thought you might be here," she responded absently as I came up.
"I remembered you lived next door to----"

She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care
of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses
who stopped at the foot of the steps.

"Hello!" they cried together. "Sorry you didn't win."

That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week
before.

"You don't know who we are," said one of the girls in yellow, "but we
met you here about a month ago."

"You've dyed your hair since then," remarked Jordan, and I started
but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the
premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's
basket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended
the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at
us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in
yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.

"Do you come to these parties often?" inquired Jordan of the girl
beside her.

"The last one was the one I met you at," answered the girl, in an alert,
confident voice. She turned to her companion: "Wasn't it for you,
Lucille?"

It was for Lucille, too.

"I like to come," Lucille said. "I never care what I do, so I always have
a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked
me my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's
with a new evening gown in it."

"Did you keep it?" asked Jordan.

"Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the
bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two
hundred and sixty-five dollars."

"There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,"
said the other girl eagerly. "He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody."

"Who doesn't?" I inquired.

"Gatsby. Somebody told me----"

The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.

"Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once."

A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and
listened eagerly.

"I don't think it's so much THAT," argued Lucille skeptically; "it's
more that he was a German spy during the war."

One of the men nodded in confirmation.

"I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in
Germany," he assured us positively.

"Oh, no," said the first girl, "it couldn't be that, because he was in
the American army during the war." As our credulity switched back to
her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. "You look at him sometimes when
he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man."

She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and
looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he
inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little
that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.

The first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now
being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were
spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were
three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate
given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression
that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person
to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party
had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the
function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East
Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its
spectroscopic gayety.

"Let's get out," whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and
inappropriate half hour. "This is much too polite for me."

We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I
had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The
undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.

The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.
She couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the
veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked
into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and
probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.

A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was
sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with
unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he
wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.

"What do you think?" he demanded impetuously.

"About what?"

He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.

"About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I
ascertained. They're real."

"The books?"

He nodded.

"Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice
durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages
and--Here! Lemme show you."

Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and
returned with Volume One of the "Stoddard Lectures."

"See!" he cried triumphantly. "It's a bona fide piece of printed matter.
It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What
thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages.
But what do you want? What do you expect?"

He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf
muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable
to collapse.

"Who brought you?" he demanded. "Or did you just come? I was brought.
Most people were brought."

Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.

"I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt," he continued. "Mrs. Claud
Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've
been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me
up to sit in a library."

"Has it?"

"A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here
an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----"

"You told us."

We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.

There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing
young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples
holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the
corners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically
or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or
the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had
sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between
the numbers people were doing "stunts" all over the garden, while happy
vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage
"twins"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in
costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.
The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of
silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the
banjoes on the lawn.

I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of
about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest
provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I
had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed
before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.

At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.

"Your face is familiar," he said, politely. "Weren't you in the Third
Division during the war?"

"Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion."

"I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd
seen you somewhere before."

We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.
Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just
bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.

"Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound."

"What time?"

"Any time that suits you best."

It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around
and smiled.

"Having a gay time now?" she inquired.

"Much better." I turned again to my new acquaintance. "This is an unusual
party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----" I waved
my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, "and this man Gatsby sent
over his chauffeur with an invitation."

For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.

"I'm Gatsby," he said suddenly.

"What!" I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon."

"I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host."

He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was
one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance
in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or
seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then
concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It
understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in
you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it
had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to
convey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an
elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate
formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he
introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his
words with care.

Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler
hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on
the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us
in turn.

"If you want anything just ask for it, old sport," he urged me.
"Excuse me. I will rejoin you later."

When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her
of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and
corpulent person in his middle years.

"Who is he?" I demanded. "Do you know?"

"He's just a man named Gatsby."

"Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?"

"Now YOU're started on the subject," she answered with a wan smile.
"Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man."

A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her
next remark it faded away.

"However, I don't believe it."

"Why not?"

"I don't know," she insisted, "I just don't think he went there."

Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think
he killed a man," and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I
would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang
from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.
That was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial
inexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy
a palace on Long Island Sound.

"Anyhow he gives large parties," said Jordan, changing the subject
with an urbane distaste for the concrete. "And I like large parties.
They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."

There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader
rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he cried. "At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are
going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted
so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers
you know there was a big sensation." He smiled with jovial condescension
and added "Some sensation!" whereupon everybody laughed.

"The piece is known," he concluded lustily, "as 'Vladimir Tostoff's
Jazz History of the World.' "

The nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as
it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps
and looking from one group to another with approving eyes.
His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and
his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could
see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was
not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed
to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.
When the "Jazz History of the World" was over girls were putting
their heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were
swooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing
that some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on
Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing
quartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.

"I beg your pardon."

Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.

"Miss Baker?" he inquired. "I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like
to speak to you alone."

"With me?" she exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes, madame."

She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,
and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore
her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there
was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to
walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.

I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and
intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which
overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now
engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who
implored me to join him, I went inside.

The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was
playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady
from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of
champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly
that everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was
weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with
gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering
soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when
they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an
inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A
humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face
whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into
a deep vinous sleep.

"She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband," explained a
girl at my elbow.

I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights
with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet
from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was
talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after
attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent
way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she
appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed "You
promised!" into his ear.

The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at
present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant
wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised
voices.

"Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home."

"Never heard anything so selfish in my life."

"We're always the first ones to leave."

"So are we."

"Well, we're almost the last tonight," said one of the men sheepishly.
"The orchestra left half an hour ago."

In spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond
credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were
lifted kicking into the night.

As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and
Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word
to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into
formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.

Jordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she
lingered for a moment to shake hands.

"I've just heard the most amazing thing," she whispered. "How long were
we in there?"

"Why,--about an hour."

"It was--simply amazing," she repeated abstractedly. "But I swore
I wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you." She yawned
gracefully in my face. "Please come and see me. . . . Phone book.
. . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . ."
She was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a
jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.

Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I
joined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I
wanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to
apologize for not having known him in the garden.

"Don't mention it," he enjoined me eagerly. "Don't give it another
thought, old sport." The familiar expression held no more familiarity
than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. "And don't forget
we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."

Then the butler, behind his shoulder:

"Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir."

"All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good
night."

"Good night."

"Good night." He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant
significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired
it all the time. "Good night, old sport. . . . Good night."

But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.
Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and
tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but
violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupÃ© which had left Gatsby's
drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the
detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from
half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars
blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been
audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of
the scene.

A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in
the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the
tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.

"See!" he explained. "It went in the ditch."

The fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the
unusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of
Gatsby's library.

"How'd it happen?"

He shrugged his shoulders.

"I know nothing whatever about mechanics," he said decisively.

"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?"

"Don't ask me," said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.
"I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened,
and that's all I know."

"Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night."

"But I wasn't even trying," he explained indignantly, "I wasn't even
trying."

An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.

"Do you want to commit suicide?"

"You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!"

"You don't understand," explained the criminal. "I wasn't driving. There's
another man in the car."

The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained
"Ah-h-h!" as the door of the coupÃ© swung slowly open. The crowd--it was
now a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide
there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale
dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the
ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.

Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant
groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before
he perceived the man in the duster.

"Wha's matter?" he inquired calmly. "Did we run outa gas?"

"Look!"

Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared
at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that
it had dropped from the sky.

"It came off," some one explained.

He nodded.

"At first I din' notice we'd stopped."

A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders
he remarked in a determined voice:

"Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?"

At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was,
explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical
bond.

"Back out," he suggested after a moment. "Put her in reverse."

"But the WHEEL'S off!"

He hesitated.

"No harm in trying," he said.

The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and
cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon
was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and
surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A
sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great
doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who
stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.


Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the
impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all
that absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a
crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less
than my personal affairs.

Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow
westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the
Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their
first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on
little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short
affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the
accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my
direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow
quietly away.

I took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the
gloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and
studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.
There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the
library so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was
mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel
and over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.

I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night
and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and
machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and
pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few
minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever
know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their
apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled
back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the
enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes,
and felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows
waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks
in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.

Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five
deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a
sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited,
and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted
cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that
I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate
excitement, I wished them well.

For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found
her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she
was a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was
something more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of
tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the
world concealed something--most affectations conceal something
eventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found
what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she
left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied
about it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded
me that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a
row that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved
her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached
the proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his
statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been
mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.

Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw
that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence
from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.
She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this
unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she
was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the
world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.

It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never
blame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that
same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a
car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our
fender flicked a button on one man's coat.

"You're a rotten driver," I protested. "Either you ought to be more
careful or you oughtn't to drive at all."

"I am careful."

"No, you're not."

"Well, other people are," she said lightly.

"What's that got to do with it?"

"They'll keep out of my way," she insisted. "It takes two to make an
accident."

"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself."

"I hope I never will," she answered. "I hate careless people. That's why
I like you."

Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had
deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved
her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes
on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of
that tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing
them: "Love, Nick," and all I could think of was how, when that certain
girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her
upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be
tactfully broken off before I was free.

Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and
this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.

On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore
the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled
hilariously on his lawn.

"He's a bootlegger," said the young ladies, moving somewhere between
his cocktails and his flowers. "One time he killed a man who had found out
that he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.
Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal
glass."

Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names
of those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table
now, disintegrating at its folds and headed "This schedule in effect
July 5th, 1922." But I can still read the grey names and they will give
you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted
Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing
whatever about him.

From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a
man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who
was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie
Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a
corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.
And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr.
Chrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned
cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.

Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only
once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named
Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles
and the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of
Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there
three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the
gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right
hand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over
sixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the
tobacco importer and Beluga's girls.

From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and
Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who
controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don
S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the
movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.
Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.
Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.
("Rot-Gut") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to
gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was
cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably
next day.

A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became
known as "the boarder"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical
people there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and
George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes
and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the
Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W.
Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry
L. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train
in Times Square.

Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite
the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with
another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have
forgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria
or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names
of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American
capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to
be.

In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came
there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had
his nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his
fiancÃ©e, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the
American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her
chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name,
if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.

All these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.


At nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car
lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody
from its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me
though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane,
and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.

"Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I
thought we'd ride up together."

He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that
resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes,
I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth
and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.
This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in
the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a
tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.

He saw me looking with admiration at his car.

"It's pretty, isn't it, old sport." He jumped off to give me a better
view. "Haven't you ever seen it before?"

I'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright
with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with
triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a
labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind
many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started
to town.

I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and
found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first
impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had
gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate
roadhouse next door.

And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg
village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished
and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored
suit.

"Look here, old sport," he broke out surprisingly. "What's your opinion
of me, anyhow?"

A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which
that question deserves.

"Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life," he interrupted.
"I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you
hear."

So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in
his halls.

"I'll tell you God's truth." His right hand suddenly ordered divine
retribution to stand by. "I am the son of some wealthy people in the
middle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at
Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.
It is a family tradition."

He looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was
lying. He hurried the phrase "educated at Oxford," or swallowed it or
choked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt
his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't
something a little sinister about him after all.

"What part of the middle-west?" I inquired casually.

"San Francisco."

"I see."

"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money."

His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan
still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg
but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.

"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of
Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting
big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to
forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago."

With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very
phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a
turbaned "character" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a
tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.

"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very
hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a
commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I
took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half
mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We
stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with
sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found
the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was
promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a
decoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic
Sea!"

Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with
his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and
sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It
appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had
elicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My
incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming
hastily through a dozen magazines.

He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell
into my palm.

"That's the one from Montenegro."

To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.

_Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.

"Turn it."

_Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.

"Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was
taken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."

It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an
archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,
looking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.

Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace
on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with
their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.

"I'm going to make a big request of you today," he said, pocketing his
souvenirs with satisfaction, "so I thought you ought to know something
about me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,
I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there
trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me." He hesitated.
"You'll hear about it this afternoon."

"At lunch?"

"No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker
to tea."

"Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?"

"No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak
to you about this matter."

I hadn't the faintest idea what "this matter" was, but I was more
annoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss
Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly
fantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his
overpopulated lawn.

He wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared
the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of
red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with
the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then
the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse
of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we
went by.

With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half
Astoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the
elevated I heard the familiar "jug--jug--SPAT!" of a motor cycle, and a
frantic policeman rode alongside.

"All right, old sport," called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white
card from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.

"Right you are," agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. "Know you next
time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!"

"What was that?" I inquired.  "The picture of Oxford?"

"I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a
Christmas card every year."

Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a
constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the
river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of
non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always
the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the
mystery and the beauty in the world.

A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two
carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for
friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short
upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of
Gatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we
crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white
chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
haughty rivalry.

"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;
"anything at all. . . ."

Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.


Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby
for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes
picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.

"Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfsheim."

A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two
fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I
discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.

"--so I took one look at him--" said Mr. Wolfsheim, shaking my hand
earnestly, "--and what do you think I did?"

"What?" I inquired politely.

But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and
covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.

"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh,
don't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and
there."

Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the
restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfsheim swallowed a new sentence he was
starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.

"Highballs?" asked the head waiter.

"This is a nice restaurant here," said Mr. Wolfsheim looking at the
Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. "But I like across the street better!"

"Yes, highballs," agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfsheim: "It's too hot
over there."

"Hot and small--yes," said Mr. Wolfsheim, "but full of memories."

"What place is that?" I asked.

"The old Metropole.

"The old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfsheim gloomily. "Filled with faces
dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so
long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us
at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was
almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says
somebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins
to get up and I pulled him down in his chair.

" 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you,
so help me, move outside this room.'

"It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds
we'd of seen daylight."

"Did he go?" I asked innocently.

"Sure he went,"--Mr. Wolfsheim's nose flashed at me indignantly--"He
turned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away
my coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him
three times in his full belly and drove away."

"Four of them were electrocuted," I said, remembering.

"Five with Becker." His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.
"I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion."

The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered
for me:

"Oh, no," he exclaimed, "this isn't the man!"

"No?" Mr. Wolfsheim seemed disappointed.

"This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other
time."

"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Wolfsheim, "I had a wrong man."

A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more
sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with
ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the
room--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly
behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one
short glance beneath our own table.

"Look here, old sport," said Gatsby, leaning toward me, "I'm afraid I
made you a little angry this morning in the car."

There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.

"I don't like mysteries," I answered. "And I don't understand why you
won't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to
come through Miss Baker?"

"Oh, it's nothing underhand," he assured me. "Miss Baker's a great
sportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right."

Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room
leaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.

"He has to telephone," said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.
"Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman."

"Yes."

"He's an Oggsford man."

"Oh!"

"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?"

"I've heard of it."

"It's one of the most famous colleges in the world."

"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?" I inquired.

"Several years," he answered in a gratified way. "I made the pleasure of
his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of
fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's
the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and
sister.' " He paused. "I see you're looking at my cuff buttons."

I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of
oddly familiar pieces of ivory.

"Finest specimens of human molars," he informed me.

"Well!" I inspected them. "That's a very interesting idea."

"Yeah." He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. "Yeah, Gatsby's very
careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife."

When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat
down Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.

"I have enjoyed my lunch," he said, "and I'm going to run off from you
two young men before I outstay my welcome."

"Don't hurry, Meyer," said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfsheim
raised his hand in a sort of benediction.

"You're very polite but I belong to another generation," he announced
solemnly. "You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and
your----" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his
hand--"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself
on you any longer."

As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.
I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.

"He becomes very sentimental sometimes," explained Gatsby. "This is one of
his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of
Broadway."

"Who is he anyhow--an actor?"

"No."

"A dentist?"

"Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler." Gatsby hesitated, then added
coolly: "He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919."

"Fixed the World's Series?" I repeated.

The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series
had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have
thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some
inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to
play with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness
of a burglar blowing a safe.

"How did he happen to do that?" I asked after a minute.

"He just saw the opportunity."

"Why isn't he in jail?"

"They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man."

I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught
sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.

"Come along with me for a minute," I said. "I've got to say hello
to someone."

When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our
direction.

"Where've you been?" he demanded eagerly. "Daisy's furious because you
haven't called up."

"This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan."

They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment
came over Gatsby's face.

"How've you been, anyhow?" demanded Tom of me. "How'd you happen to come
up this far to eat?"

"I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby."

I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.


One October day in nineteen-seventeen----
(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight
chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)
--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and
half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from
England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.
I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and
whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all
the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving
way.

The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to
Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and
by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She
dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long
the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp
Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, "anyways,
for an hour!"

When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside
the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen
before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until
I was five feet away.

"Hello Jordan," she called unexpectedly. "Please come here."

I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older
girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and
make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come
that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way
that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it
seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name
was Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four
years--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the
same man.

That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself,
and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often.
She went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all.
Wild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her
packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a
soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she
wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After
that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only
with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't
get into the army at all.

By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut
after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a
man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with
more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came
down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole
floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her
a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal
dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in
her flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of
sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.

" 'Gratulate me," she muttered. "Never had a drink before but oh, how I do
enjoy it."

"What's the matter, Daisy?"

I was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.

"Here, dearis." She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her
on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. "Take 'em downstairs and
give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her
mine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'."

She began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her
mother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She
wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and
squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the
soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.

But she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put
ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an
hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her
neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom
Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months'
trip to the South Seas.

I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd
never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a
minute she'd look around uneasily and say "Where's Tom gone?" and
wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the
door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour
rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable
delight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a
hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa
Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped
a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the
papers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids
in the Santa Barbara Hotel.

The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a
year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then
they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago,
as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich
and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.
Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink
among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover,
you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else
is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in
for amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .

Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time
in years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby
in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me
up, and said "What Gatsby?" and when I described him--I was half
asleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used
to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the
officer in her white car.


When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza
for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.
The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in
the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like
crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:


    "I'm the Sheik of Araby,
    Your love belongs to me.
    At night when you're asleep,
    Into your tent I'll creep----"


"It was a strange coincidence," I said.

"But it wasn't a coincidence at all."

"Why not?"

"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay."

Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired
on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the
womb of his purposeless splendor.

"He wants to know--" continued Jordan "--if you'll invite Daisy to your
house some afternoon and then let him come over."

The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a
mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could
"come over" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.

"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?"

"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended.
You see he's a regular tough underneath it all."

Something worried me.

"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?"

"He wants her to see his house," she explained. "And your house is right
next door."

"Oh!"

"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties,
some night," went on Jordan, "but she never did. Then he began asking
people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.
It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have
heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately
suggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:

" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to
see her right next door.'

"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon
the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's
read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse
of Daisy's name."

It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm
around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to
dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of
this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and
who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began
to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: "There are only the
pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."

"And Daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured Jordan to me.

"Does she want to see Gatsby?"

"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're
just supposed to invite her to tea."

We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth
Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.
Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face
floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the
girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so
I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.


When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that
my house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula
was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin
elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it
was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.

At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved
itself into "hide-and-go-seek" or "sardines-in-the-box" with all the
house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in
the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again
as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I
saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.

"Your place looks like the world's fair," I said.

"Does it?" He turned his eyes toward it absently. "I have been glancing
into some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car."

"It's too late."

"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use
of it all summer."

"I've got to go to bed."

"All right."

He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

"I talked with Miss Baker," I said after a moment. "I'm going to call up
Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea."

"Oh, that's all right," he said carelessly. "I don't want to put you to
any trouble."

"What day would suit you?"

"What day would suit YOU?" he corrected me quickly. "I don't want to put
you to any trouble, you see."

"How about the day after tomorrow?" He considered for a moment. Then,
with reluctance:

"I want to get the grass cut," he said.

We both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn
ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that
he meant my grass.

"There's another little thing," he said uncertainly, and hesitated.

"Would you rather put it off for a few days?" I asked.

"Oh, it isn't about that. At least----" He fumbled with a series of
beginnings. "Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make
much money, do you?"

"Not very much."

This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.

"I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a
little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I
thought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't
you, old sport?"

"Trying to."

"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your
time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be
a rather confidential sort of thing."

I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might
have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was
obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice
except to cut him off there.

"I've got my hands full," I said. "I'm much obliged but I couldn't take
on any more work."

"You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim." Evidently he
thought that I was shying away from the "gonnegtion" mentioned at lunch,
but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd
begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went
unwillingly home.

The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a
deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not
Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he "glanced into
rooms" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the
office next morning and invited her to come to tea.

"Don't bring Tom," I warned her.

"What?"

"Don't bring Tom."

"Who is 'Tom'?" she asked innocently.

The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a
raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that
Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I
had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg
Village to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy
some cups and lemons and flowers.

The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived
from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour
later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel
suit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and
there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.

"Is everything all right?" he asked immediately.

"The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean."

"What grass?" he inquired blankly. "Oh, the grass in the yard." He looked
out the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe
he saw a thing.

"Looks very good," he remarked vaguely. "One of the papers said they
thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have
you got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?"

I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the
Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen
shop.

"Will they do?" I asked.

"Of course, of course! They're fine!" and he added hollowly, ". . .old
sport."

The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which
occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes
through a copy of Clay's "Economics," starting at the Finnish tread that
shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time
to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking
place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice
that he was going home.

"Why's that?"

"Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!" He looked at his watch as if
there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. "I can't wait
all day."

"Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four."

He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there
was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and,
a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.

Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the
drive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a
three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic
smile.

"Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?"

The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had
to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone
before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of
blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as
I took it to help her from the car.

"Are you in love with me," she said low in my ear. "Or why did I have
to come alone?"

"That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far
away and spend an hour."

"Come back in an hour, Ferdie." Then in a grave murmur, "His name is
Ferdie."

"Does the gasoline affect his nose?"

"I don't think so," she said innocently. "Why?"

We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.

"Well, that's funny!" I exclaimed.

"What's funny?"

She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front
door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands
plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of
water glaring tragically into my eyes.

With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the
hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the
living room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own
heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.

For half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I
heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's
voice on a clear artificial note.

"I certainly am awfully glad to see you again."

A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went
into the room.

Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the
mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.
His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a
defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes
stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the
edge of a stiff chair.

"We've met before," muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at
me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily
the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his
head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set
it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the
sofa and his chin in his hand.

"I'm sorry about the clock," he said.

My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up
a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.

"It's an old clock," I told them idiotically.

I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on
the floor.

"We haven't met for many years," said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact
as it could ever be.

"Five years next November."

The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another
minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that
they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in
on a tray.

Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency
established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy
and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with
tense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I
made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.

"Where are you going?" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.

"I'll be back."

"I've got to speak to you about something before you go."

He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered:
"Oh, God!" in a miserable way.

"What's the matter?"

"This is a terrible mistake," he said, shaking his head from side to
side, "a terrible, terrible mistake."

"You're just embarrassed, that's all," and luckily I added: "Daisy's
embarrassed too."

"She's embarrassed?" he repeated incredulously.

"Just as much as you are."

"Don't talk so loud."

"You're acting like a little boy," I broke out impatiently. "Not only
that but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone."


He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable
reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.

I walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his
nervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge
black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.
Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by
Gatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric
marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except
Gatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church
steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the "period"
craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay
five years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would
have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the
heart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate
decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the
door. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always
been obstinate about being peasantry.

After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile
rounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I
felt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper
windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a
large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I
went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of
their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of
emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within
the house too.

I went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of
pushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They
were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if
some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of
embarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I
came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before
a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.
He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new
well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.

"Oh, hello, old sport," he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I
thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.

"It's stopped raining."

"Has it?" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were
twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,
like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to
Daisy. "What do you think of that? It's stopped raining."

"I'm glad, Jay." Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only
of her unexpected joy.

"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house," he said, "I'd like to
show her around."

"You're sure you want me to come?"

"Absolutely, old sport."

Daisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation
of my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.

"My house looks well, doesn't it?" he demanded. "See how the whole
front of it catches the light."

I agreed that it was splendid.

"Yes." His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. "It took
me just three years to earn the money that bought it."

"I thought you inherited your money."

"I did, old sport," he said automatically, "but I lost most of it in
the big panic--the panic of the war."

I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what
business he was in he answered "That's my affair," before he realized
that it wasn't the appropriate reply.

"Oh, I've been in several things," he corrected himself. "I was in the
drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either
one now." He looked at me with more attention. "Do you mean you've been
thinking over what I proposed the other night?"

Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass
buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.

"That huge place THERE?" she cried pointing.

"Do you like it?"

"I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone."

"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who
do interesting things. Celebrated people."

Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and
entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this
aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the
gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn
and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.
It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright
dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the
trees.

And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and
Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind
every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we
had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of "the Merton College
Library" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into
ghostly laughter.

We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender
silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms,
and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a
dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It
was Mr. Klipspringer, the "boarder." I had seen him wandering hungrily
about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment,
a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a
glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.

He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued
everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew
from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his
possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding
presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a
flight of stairs.

His bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was
garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush
with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and
shaded his eyes and began to laugh.

"It's the funniest thing, old sport," he said hilariously. "I can't--when
I try to----"

He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.
After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with
wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it
right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an
inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running
down like an overwound clock.

Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent
cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and
his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.

"I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection
of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall."

He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one
before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel
which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in
many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft
rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in
coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of
Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into
the shirts and began to cry stormily.

"They're such beautiful shirts," she sobbed, her voice muffled in the
thick folds. "It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful
shirts before."


After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the
hydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it
began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated
surface of the Sound.

"If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay," said
Gatsby. "You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of
your dock."

Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed
in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the
colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared
to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed
very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star
to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of
enchanted objects had diminished by one.

I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in
the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting
costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.

"Who's this?"

"That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport."

The name sounded faintly familiar.

"He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago."

There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the
bureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently
when he was about eighteen.

"I adore it!" exclaimed Daisy. "The pompadour! You never told me you had
a pompadour--or a yacht."

"Look at this," said Gatsby quickly. "Here's a lot of clippings--about
you."

They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies
when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.

"Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old
sport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town
is. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small
town. . . ."

He rang off.

"Come here QUICK!" cried Daisy at the window.

The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,
and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.

"Look at that," she whispered, and then after a moment: "I'd like to
just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you
around."

I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence
made them feel more satisfactorily alone.

"I know what we'll do," said Gatsby, "we'll have Klipspringer play the
piano."

He went out of the room calling "Ewing!" and returned in a few
minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with
shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed
in a "sport shirt" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a
nebulous hue.

"Did we interrupt your exercises?" inquired Daisy politely.

"I was asleep," cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.
"That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . ."

"Klipspringer plays the piano," said Gatsby, cutting him off. "Don't you,
Ewing, old sport?"

"I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of
prac----"

"We'll go downstairs," interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The
grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.

In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He
lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on
a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the
gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.

When Klipspringer had played "The Love Nest" he turned around on the
bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.

"I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all
out of prac----"

"Don't talk so much, old sport," commanded Gatsby. "Play!"


    IN THE MORNING,
    IN THE EVENING,
       AIN'T WE GOT FUN----

Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the
Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains,
men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was
the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on
the air.


    ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER
    THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.
       IN THE MEANTIME,
       IN BETWEEN TIME----


As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment
had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to
him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five
years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when
Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but
because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond
her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative
passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright
feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can
challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.

As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took
hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward
her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its
fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that
voice was a deathless song.

They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;
Gatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they
looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out
of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there
together.

About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one
morning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.

"Anything to say about what?" inquired Gatsby politely.

"Why,--any statement to give out."

It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard
Gatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either
wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off
and with laudable initiative he had hurried out "to see."

It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's
notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his
hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased
all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary
legends such as the "underground pipe-line to Canada" attached
themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he
didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house
and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why
these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North
Dakota, isn't easy to say.

James Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had
changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that
witnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop
anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz
who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green
jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who
borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that
a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.

I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His
parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had
never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that
Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic
conception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means
anything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business,
the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented
just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be
likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.

For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of
Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other
capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived
naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.
He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous
of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others
because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming
self-absorption he took for granted.

But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque
and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe
of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the
clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet
light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the
pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid
scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an
outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the
unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded
securely on a fairy's wing.

An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to
the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed
there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of
his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with
which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake
Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day
that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.

Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,
of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The
transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire
found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,
suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from
his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the
newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him
to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism
of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five
years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.

To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed
deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I
suppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked
him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of
them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and
extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and
bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting
cap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary
Coast Gatsby left too.

He was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with
Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor,
for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be
about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more
trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the
boat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted
indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night
in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.

I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid
man with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase
of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage
violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to
Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties
women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the
habit of letting liquor alone.

And it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five
thousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal
device that was used against him but what remained of the millions
went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate
education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the
substantiality of a man.


He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the
idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which
weren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of
confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and
nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while
Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of
misconceptions away.

It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For
several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly
I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to
ingratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to
his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when
somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled,
naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened
before.

They were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and
a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.

"I'm delighted to see you," said Gatsby standing on his porch.
"I'm delighted that you dropped in."

As though they cared!

"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar." He walked around the room
quickly, ringing bells. "I'll have something to drink for you in just
a minute."

He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be
uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague
way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A
lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,
thanks. . . . I'm sorry----

"Did you have a nice ride?"

"Very good roads around here."

"I suppose the automobiles----"

"Yeah."

Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted
the introduction as a stranger.

"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan."

"Oh, yes," said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.
"So we did. I remember very well."

"About two weeks ago."

"That's right. You were with Nick here."

"I know your wife," continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.

"That so?"

Tom turned to me.

"You live near here, Nick?"

"Next door."

"That so?"

Mr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily
in his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after
two highballs, she became cordial.

"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby," she suggested.
"What do you say?"

"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you."

"Be ver' nice," said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. "Well--think ought to
be starting home."

"Please don't hurry," Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now
and he wanted to see more of Tom. "Why don't you--why don't you stay for
supper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from
New York."

"You come to supper with ME," said the lady enthusiastically.
"Both of you."

This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.

"Come along," he said--but to her only.

"I mean it," she insisted. "I'd love to have you. Lots of room."

Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see
that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.

"I'm afraid I won't be able to," I said.

"Well, you come," she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.

Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.

"We won't be late if we start now," she insisted aloud.

"I haven't got a horse," said Gatsby. "I used to ride in the army but
I've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me
for just a minute."

The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began
an impassioned conversation aside.

"My God, I believe the man's coming," said Tom. "Doesn't he know she
doesn't want him?"

"She says she does want him."

"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there." He frowned.
"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be
old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to
suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish."

Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted
their horses.

"Come on," said Mr. Sloane to Tom, "we're late. We've got to go." And then
to me: "Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?"

Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and
they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August
foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out
the front door.

Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the
following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps
his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it
stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There
were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same
profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion,
but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that
hadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it,
grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own
standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had
no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again,
through Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new
eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of
adjustment.

They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling
hundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.

"These things excite me SO," she whispered. "If you want to kiss me
any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad
to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.
I'm giving out green----"

"Look around," suggested Gatsby.

"I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----"

"You must see the faces of many people you've heard about."

Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.

"We don't go around very much," he said. "In fact I was just thinking
I don't know a soul here."

"Perhaps you know that lady." Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human
orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy
stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the
recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.

"She's lovely," said Daisy.

"The man bending over her is her director."

He took them ceremoniously from group to group:

"Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----" After an instant's hesitation
he added: "the polo player."

"Oh no," objected Tom quickly, "Not me."

But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained "the polo
player" for the rest of the evening.

"I've never met so many celebrities!" Daisy exclaimed. "I liked that
man--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose."

Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.

"Well, I liked him anyhow."

"I'd a little rather not be the polo player," said Tom pleasantly, "I'd
rather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion."

Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,
conservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they
sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while
at her request I remained watchfully in the garden: "In case there's a
fire or a flood," she explained, "or any act of God."

Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.
"Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?" he said. "A fellow's
getting off some funny stuff."

"Go ahead," answered Daisy genially, "And if you want to take down any
addresses here's my little gold pencil. . . ." She looked around after
a moment and told me the girl was "common but pretty," and I knew that
except for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having
a good time.

We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had
been called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two
weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.

"How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?"

The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my
shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.

"Wha?"

A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf
with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:

"Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always
starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone."

"I do leave it alone," affirmed the accused hollowly.

"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody
that needs your help, Doc.' "

"She's much obliged, I'm sure," said another friend, without gratitude.
"But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool."

"Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool," mumbled Miss
Baedeker. "They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey."

"Then you ought to leave it alone," countered Doctor Civet.

"Speak for yourself!" cried Miss Baedeker violently. "Your hand shakes.
I wouldn't let you operate on me!"

It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with
Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were
still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except
for a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he
had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this
proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree
and kiss at her cheek.

"I like her," said Daisy, "I think she's lovely."

But the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but
an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented "place"
that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled
by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too
obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing
to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed
to understand.

I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It
was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of
light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow
moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,
an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an
invisible glass.

"Who is this Gatsby anyhow?" demanded Tom suddenly. "Some big bootlegger?"

"Where'd you hear that?" I inquired.

"I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are
just big bootleggers, you know."

"Not Gatsby," I said shortly.

He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his
feet.

"Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie
together."

A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.

"At least they're more interesting than the people we know," she said
with an effort.

"You didn't look so interested."

"Well, I was."

Tom laughed and turned to me.

"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under
a cold shower?"

Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,
bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had
before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice
broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and
each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.

"Lots of people come who haven't been invited," she said suddenly.
"That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's
too polite to object."

"I'd like to know who he is and what he does," insisted Tom. "And I think
I'll make a point of finding out."

"I can tell you right now," she answered. "He owned some drug stores,
a lot of drug stores. He built them up himself."

The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.

"Good night, Nick," said Daisy.

Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where
"Three o'Clock in the Morning," a neat, sad little waltz of that year,
was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of
Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from
her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling
her back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?
Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare
and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with
one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot
out those five years of unwavering devotion.


I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free
and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run
up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were
extinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at
last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes
were bright and tired.

"She didn't like it," he said immediately.

"Of course she did."

"She didn't like it," he insisted. "She didn't have a good time."

He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.

"I feel far away from her," he said. "It's hard to make her understand."

"You mean about the dance?"

"The dance?" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of
his fingers. "Old sport, the dance is unimportant."

He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say:
"I never loved you." After she had obliterated three years with that
sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.
One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to
Louisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five
years ago.

"And she doesn't understand," he said. "She used to be able to
understand. We'd sit for hours----"

He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds
and discarded favors and crushed flowers.

"I wouldn't ask too much of her," I ventured. "You can't repeat the past."

"Can't repeat the past?" he cried incredulously. "Why of course you can!"

He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the
shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.

"I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before," he said,
nodding determinedly. "She'll see."

He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover
something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.
His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could
once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he
could find out what that thing was. . . .

. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down
the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where
there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.
They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night
with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of
the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the
darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the
corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really
formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could
climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the
pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.

His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his
own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his
unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp
again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer
to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed
her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the
incarnation was complete.

Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was
reminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that
I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to
take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though
there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But
they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was
uncommunicable forever.


It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights
in his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it
had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.

Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned
expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove
sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an
unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously
from the door.

"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?"

"Nope." After a pause he added "sir" in a dilatory, grudging way.

"I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway
came over."

"Who?" he demanded rudely.

"Carraway."

"Carraway. All right, I'll tell him." Abruptly he slammed the door.

My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his
house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never
went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered
moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the
kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was
that the new people weren't servants at all.

Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.

"Going away?" I inquired.

"No, old sport."

"I hear you fired all your servants."

"I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in
the afternoons."

So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the
disapproval in her eyes.

"They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for. They're all
brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel."

"I see."

He was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at
her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later
Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.
Something was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose
this occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene
that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.

The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of
the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the
hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush
at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;
the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white
shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers,
lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book
slapped to the floor.

"Oh, my!" she gasped.

I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it
at arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that
I had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman,
suspected me just the same.

"Hot!" said the conductor to familiar faces. "Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?"

My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.
That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,
whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!

. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind,
carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we
waited at the door.

"The master's body!" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. "I'm sorry,
madame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!"

What he really said was: "Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see."

He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take
our stiff straw hats.

"Madame expects you in the salon!" he cried, needlessly indicating the
direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the
common store of life.

The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and
Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down
their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.

"We can't move," they said together.

Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in
mine.

"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?" I inquired.

Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall
telephone.

Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with
fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting
laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.

"The rumor is," whispered Jordan, "that that's Tom's girl on the
telephone."

We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.
"Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm
under no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me
about it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!"

"Holding down the receiver," said Daisy cynically.

"No, he's not," I assured her. "It's a bona fide deal. I happen to
know about it."

Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his
thick body, and hurried into the room.

"Mr. Gatsby!" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed
dislike. "I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . ."

"Make us a cold drink," cried Daisy.

As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled
his face down kissing him on the mouth.

"You know I love you," she murmured.

"You forget there's a lady present," said Jordan.

Daisy looked around doubtfully.

"You kiss Nick too."

"What a low, vulgar girl!"

"I don't care!" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.
Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as
a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.

"Bles-sed pre-cious," she crooned, holding out her arms. "Come to your
own mother that loves you."

The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted
shyly into her mother's dress.

"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy
hair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do."

Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.
Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had
ever really believed in its existence before.

"I got dressed before luncheon," said the child, turning eagerly to
Daisy.

"That's because your mother wanted to show you off." Her face bent into
the single wrinkle of the small white neck. "You dream, you. You absolute
little dream."

"Yes," admitted the child calmly. "Aunt Jordan's got on a white
dress too."

"How do you like mother's friends?" Daisy turned her around so that she
faced Gatsby. "Do you think they're pretty?"

"Where's Daddy?"

"She doesn't look like her father," explained Daisy. "She looks like me.
She's got my hair and shape of the face."

Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held
out her hand.

"Come, Pammy."

"Goodbye, sweetheart!"

With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her
nurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,
preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.

Gatsby took up his drink.

"They certainly look cool," he said, with visible tension.

We drank in long greedy swallows.

"I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year," said Tom
genially. "It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the
sun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder
every year.

"Come outside," he suggested to Gatsby, "I'd like you to have a look at
the place."

I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the
heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes
followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.

"I'm right across from you."

"So you are."

Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse
of the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved
against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and
the abounding blessed isles.

"There's sport for you," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like to be out there
with him for about an hour."

We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat,
and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.

"What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon," cried Daisy, "and the
day after that, and the next thirty years?"

"Don't be morbid," Jordan said. "Life starts all over again when it gets
crisp in the fall."

"But it's so hot," insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, "And
everything's so confused. Let's all go to town!"

Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its
senselessness into forms.

"I've heard of making a garage out of a stable," Tom was saying to
Gatsby, "but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage."

"Who wants to go to town?" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes
floated toward her. "Ah," she cried, "you look so cool."

Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.
With an effort she glanced down at the table.

"You always look so cool," she repeated.

She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was
astounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then
back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a
long time ago.

"You resemble the advertisement of the man," she went on innocently.
"You know the advertisement of the man----"

"All right," broke in Tom quickly, "I'm perfectly willing to go to
town. Come on--we're all going to town."

He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.
No one moved.

"Come on!" His temper cracked a little. "What's the matter, anyhow?
If we're going to town let's start."

His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the
last of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on
to the blazing gravel drive.

"Are we just going to go?" she objected. "Like this? Aren't we going to
let any one smoke a cigarette first?"

"Everybody smoked all through lunch."

"Oh, let's have fun," she begged him. "It's too hot to fuss."

He didn't answer.

"Have it your own way," she said. "Come on, Jordan."

They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling
the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already
in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not
before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.

"Have you got your stables here?" asked Gatsby with an effort.

"About a quarter of a mile down the road."

"Oh."

A pause.

"I don't see the idea of going to town," broke out Tom savagely.
"Women get these notions in their heads----"

"Shall we take anything to drink?" called Daisy from an upper window.

"I'll get some whiskey," answered Tom. He went inside.

Gatsby turned to me rigidly:

"I can't say anything in his house, old sport."

"She's got an indiscreet voice," I remarked. "It's full of----"

I hesitated.

"Her voice is full of money," he said suddenly.

That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was
the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the
cymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter,
the golden girl. . . .

Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed
by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and
carrying light capes over their arms.

"Shall we all go in my car?" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green
leather of the seat. "I ought to have left it in the shade."

"Is it standard shift?" demanded Tom.

"Yes."

"Well, you take my coupÃ© and let me drive your car to town."

The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.

"I don't think there's much gas," he objected.

"Plenty of gas," said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.
"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a
drug store nowadays."

A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom
frowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar
and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words,
passed over Gatsby's face.

"Come on, Daisy," said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's
car. "I'll take you in this circus wagon."

He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.

"You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coupÃ©."

She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and
Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the
unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat
leaving them out of sight behind.

"Did you see that?" demanded Tom.

"See what?"

He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all
along.

"You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?" he suggested. "Perhaps I am, but
I have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.
Maybe you don't believe that, but science----"

He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from
the edge of the theoretical abyss.

"I've made a small investigation of this fellow," he continued. "I could
have gone deeper if I'd known----"

"Do you mean you've been to a medium?" inquired Jordan humorously.

"What?" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. "A medium?"

"About Gatsby."

"About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small
investigation of his past."

"And you found he was an Oxford man," said Jordan helpfully.

"An Oxford man!" He was incredulous. "Like hell he is! He wears a
pink suit."

"Nevertheless he's an Oxford man."

"Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom contemptuously, "or something like
that."

"Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?"
demanded Jordan crossly.

"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows
where!"

We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it,
we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded
eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about
gasoline.

"We've got enough to get us to town," said Tom.

"But there's a garage right here," objected Jordan. "I don't want to get
stalled in this baking heat."

Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt
dusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged
from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.

"Let's have some gas!" cried Tom roughly. "What do you think we stopped
for--to admire the view?"

"I'm sick," said Wilson without moving. "I been sick all day."

"What's the matter?"

"I'm all run down."

"Well, shall I help myself?" Tom demanded. "You sounded well enough
on the phone."

With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,
breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face
was green.

"I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch," he said. "But I need money
pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your
old car."

"How do you like this one?" inquired Tom. "I bought it last week."

"It's a nice yellow one," said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.

"Like to buy it?"

"Big chance," Wilson smiled faintly. "No, but I could make some money
on the other."

"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?"

"I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to
go west."

"Your wife does!" exclaimed Tom, startled.

"She's been talking about it for ten years." He rested for a moment
against the pump, shading his eyes. "And now she's going whether she wants
to or not. I'm going to get her away."

The coupÃ© flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a
waving hand.

"What do I owe you?" demanded Tom harshly.

"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days," remarked
Wilson. "That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you
about the car."

"What do I owe you?"

"Dollar twenty."

The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had
a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions
hadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some
sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had
made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made
a parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me
that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so
profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so
sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got
some poor girl with child.

"I'll let you have that car," said Tom. "I'll send it over tomorrow
afternoon."

That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad
glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been
warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of
Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after
a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity
from less than twenty feet away.

In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside
a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed
was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one
emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly
developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an
expression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's
face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her
eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan
Baker, whom she took to be his wife.


There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we
drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his
mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping
precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the
accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving
Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,
until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of
the easygoing blue coupÃ©.

"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool," suggested Jordan.
"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's
something very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny
fruits were going to fall into your hands."

The word "sensuous" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before
he could invent a protest the coupÃ© came to a stop and Daisy signalled us
to draw up alongside.

"Where are we going?" she cried.

"How about the movies?"

"It's so hot," she complained. "You go. We'll ride around and meet you
after." With an effort her wit rose faintly, "We'll meet you on some
corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes."

"We can't argue about it here," Tom said impatiently as a truck gave
out a cursing whistle behind us. "You follow me to the south side of
Central Park, in front of the Plaza."

Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car,
and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into
sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out
of his life forever.

But they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging
the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.

The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into
that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the
course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my
legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The
notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms
and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as "a place to
have a mint julep." Each of us said over and over that it was a "crazy
idea"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or
pretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .

The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four
o'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from
the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,
fixing her hair.

"It's a swell suite," whispered Jordan respectfully and every one
laughed.

"Open another window," commanded Daisy, without turning around.

"There aren't any more."

"Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----"

"The thing to do is to forget about the heat," said Tom impatiently.
"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it."

He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.

"Why not let her alone, old sport?" remarked Gatsby. "You're the one that
wanted to come to town."

There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail
and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered "Excuse me"--but
this time no one laughed.

"I'll pick it up," I offered.

"I've got it." Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered "Hum!" in an
interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.

"That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?" said Tom sharply.

"What is?"

"All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?"

"Now see here, Tom," said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, "if
you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call
up and order some ice for the mint julep."

As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and
we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March
from the ballroom below.

"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!" cried Jordan dismally.

"Still--I was married in the middle of June," Daisy remembered,
"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?"

"Biloxi," he answered shortly.

"A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a
fact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee."

"They carried him into my house," appended Jordan, "because we lived
just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy
told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died." After a
moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, "There
wasn't any connection."

"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.

"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.
He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today."

The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated
in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of "Yea--ea--ea!"
and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.

"We're getting old," said Daisy. "If we were young we'd rise and dance."

"Remember Biloxi," Jordan warned her. "Where'd you know him, Tom?"

"Biloxi?" He concentrated with an effort. "I didn't know him. He was a
friend of Daisy's."

"He was not," she denied. "I'd never seen him before. He came down in
the private car."

"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.
Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room
for him."

Jordan smiled.

"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of
your class at Yale."

Tom and I looked at each other blankly.

"BilOxi?"

"First place, we didn't have any president----"

Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.

"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man."

"Not exactly."

"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford."

"Yes--I went there."

A pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:

"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven."

Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but
the silence was unbroken by his "Thank you" and the soft closing of the
door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.

"I told you I went there," said Gatsby.

"I heard you, but I'd like to know when."

"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I
can't really call myself an Oxford man."

Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all
looking at Gatsby.

"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the
Armistice," he continued. "We could go to any of the universities in
England or France."

I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals
of complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.

Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.

"Open the whiskey, Tom," she ordered. "And I'll make you a mint julep.
Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!"

"Wait a minute," snapped Tom, "I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more
question."

"Go on," Gatsby said politely.

"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?"

They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.

"He isn't causing a row." Daisy looked desperately from one to the
other. "You're causing a row. Please have a little self control."

"Self control!" repeated Tom incredulously. "I suppose the latest thing
is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.
Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin
by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll
throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black
and white."

Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on
the last barrier of civilization.

"We're all white here," murmured Jordan.

"I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose
you've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any
friends--in the modern world."

Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened
his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.

"I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----" began Gatsby. But Daisy
guessed at his intention.

"Please don't!" she interrupted helplessly. "Please let's all go home.
Why don't we all go home?"

"That's a good idea." I got up. "Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink."

"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me."

"Your wife doesn't love you," said Gatsby. "She's never loved you.
She loves me."

"You must be crazy!" exclaimed Tom automatically.

Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.

"She never loved you, do you hear?" he cried. "She only married you
because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible
mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!"

At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with
competitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had
anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously
of their emotions.

"Sit down Daisy." Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal
note. "What's been going on? I want to hear all about it."

"I told you what's been going on," said Gatsby. "Going on for five
years--and you didn't know."

Tom turned to Daisy sharply.

"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?"

"Not seeing," said Gatsby. "No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved
each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh
sometimes--"but there was no laughter in his eyes, "to think that you
didn't know."

"Oh--that's all." Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman
and leaned back in his chair.

"You're crazy!" he exploded. "I can't speak about what happened five years
ago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you
got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back
door. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when
she married me and she loves me now."

"No," said Gatsby, shaking his head.

"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas
in her head and doesn't know what she's doing." He nodded sagely. "And
what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree
and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I
love her all the time."

"You're revolting," said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,
dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: "Do you
know why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to
the story of that little spree."

Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.

"Daisy, that's all over now," he said earnestly. "It doesn't matter any
more. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all
wiped out forever."

She looked at him blindly. "Why,--how could I love him--possibly?"

"You never loved him."

She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,
as though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had
never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.
It was too late.

"I never loved him," she said, with perceptible reluctance.

"Not at Kapiolani?" demanded Tom suddenly.

"No."

From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up
on hot waves of air.

"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes
dry?" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. ". . . Daisy?"

"Please don't." Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.
She looked at Gatsby. "There, Jay," she said--but her hand as she tried
to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and
the burning match on the carpet.

"Oh, you want too much!" she cried to Gatsby. "I love you now--isn't that
enough? I can't help what's past." She began to sob helplessly.
"I did love him once--but I loved you too."

Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.

"You loved me TOO?" he repeated.

"Even that's a lie," said Tom savagely. "She didn't know you were alive.
Why,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know,
things that neither of us can ever forget."

The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.

"I want to speak to Daisy alone," he insisted. "She's all excited now----"

"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom," she admitted in a pitiful
voice. "It wouldn't be true."

"Of course it wouldn't," agreed Tom.

She turned to her husband.

"As if it mattered to you," she said.

"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on."

"You don't understand," said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. "You're not
going to take care of her any more."

"I'm not?" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to
control himself now. "Why's that?"

"Daisy's leaving you."

"Nonsense."

"I am, though," she said with a visible effort.

"She's not leaving me!" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.
"Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he
put on her finger."

"I won't stand this!" cried Daisy. "Oh, please let's get out."

"Who are you, anyhow?" broke out Tom. "You're one of that bunch that
hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim--that much I happen to know. I've made
a little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further
tomorrow."

"You can suit yourself about that, old sport." said Gatsby steadily.

"I found out what your 'drug stores' were." He turned to us and spoke
rapidly. "He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores
here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of
his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw
him and I wasn't far wrong."

"What about it?" said Gatsby politely. "I guess your friend Walter Chase
wasn't too proud to come in on it."

"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for
a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject
of YOU."

"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old
sport."

"Don't you call me 'old sport'!" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.
"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared
him into shutting his mouth."

That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.

"That drug store business was just small change," continued Tom slowly,
"but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me
about."

I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby
and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible
but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to
Gatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said
in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had
"killed a man." For a moment the set of his face could be described in
just that fantastic way.

It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything,
defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with
every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave
that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped
away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling
unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.

The voice begged again to go.

"PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more."

Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage
she had had, were definitely gone.

"You two start on home, Daisy," said Tom. "In Mr. Gatsby's car."

She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.

"Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous
little flirtation is over."

They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated,
like ghosts even from our pity.

After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of
whiskey in the towel.

"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?"

I didn't answer.

"Nick?" He asked again.

"What?"

"Want any?"

"No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday."

I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a
new decade.

It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupÃ© with him and started
for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his
voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the
sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy
has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments
fade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade
of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning
brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside
me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten
dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face
fell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of
thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.

So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.


The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the
ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through
the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and
found George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own
pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but
Wilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did.
While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke
out overhead.

"I've got my wife locked in up there," explained Wilson calmly.
"She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're
going to move away."

Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and
Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally
he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a
chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed
along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an
agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.

So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson
wouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious
glances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain
times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some
workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took
the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't.
He supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again
a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he
heard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.

"Beat me!" he heard her cry. "Throw me down and beat me, you dirty
little coward!"

A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and
shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.

The "death car" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out
of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then
disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its
color--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other
car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards
beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life
violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark
blood with the dust.

Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open
her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left
breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen
for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the
corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous
vitality she had stored so long.


We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still
some distance away.

"Wreck!" said Tom. "That's good. Wilson'll have a little business
at last."

He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until,
as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage
door made him automatically put on the brakes.

"We'll take a look," he said doubtfully, "just a look."

I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly
from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupÃ© and walked
toward the door resolved itself into the words "Oh, my God!" uttered over
and over in a gasping moan.

"There's some bad trouble here," said Tom excitedly.

He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the
garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket
overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent
thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.

The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it
was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals
disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.

Myrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another
blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a
work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over
it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down
names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I
couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed
clamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the
raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to
the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low
voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder,
but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the
swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to
the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.

"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!"

Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the
garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the
policeman.

"M-a-v--" the policeman was saying, "--o----"

"No,--r--" corrected the man, "M-a-v-r-o----"

"Listen to me!" muttered Tom fiercely.

"r--" said the policeman, "o----"

"g----"

"g--" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.
"What you want, fella?"

"What happened--that's what I want to know!"

"Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."

"Instantly killed," repeated Tom, staring.

"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car."

"There was two cars," said Michaelis, "one comin', one goin', see?"

"Going where?" asked the policeman keenly.

"One goin' each way. Well, she--" His hand rose toward the blankets but
stopped half way and fell to his side, "--she ran out there an' the one
comin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an
hour."

"What's the name of this place here?" demanded the officer.

"Hasn't got any name."

A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.

"It was a yellow car," he said, "big yellow car. New."

"See the accident?" asked the policeman.

"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going
fifty, sixty."

"Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his
name."

Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying
in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among
his gasping cries.

"You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of
car it was!"

Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten
under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing
in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.

"You've got to pull yourself together," he said with soothing
gruffness.

Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then
would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.

"Listen," said Tom, shaking him a little. "I just got here a minute ago,
from New York. I was bringing you that coupÃ© we've been talking about.
That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I
haven't seen it all afternoon."

Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the
policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent
eyes.

"What's all that?" he demanded.

"I'm a friend of his." Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on
Wilson's body. "He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow
car."

Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.

"And what color's your car?"

"It's a blue car, a coupÃ©."

"We've come straight from New York," I said.

Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and
the policeman turned away.

"Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----"

Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office,
set him down in a chair and came back.

"If somebody'll come here and sit with him!" he snapped
authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced
at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the
door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the
table. As he passed close to me he whispered "Let's get out."

Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we
pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,
case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.

Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down
hard and the coupÃ© raced along through the night. In a little while I
heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his
face.

"The God Damn coward!" he whimpered. "He didn't even stop his car."


The Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling
trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor
where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.

"Daisy's home," he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and
frowned slightly.

"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can
do tonight."

A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.
As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of
the situation in a few brisk phrases.

"I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting
you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some
supper--if you want any." He opened the door. "Come in."

"No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait
outside."

Jordan put her hand on my arm.

"Won't you come in, Nick?"

"No thanks."

I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered
for a moment more.

"It's only half past nine," she said.

I'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day
and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of
this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the
porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head
in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's
voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the
house intending to wait by the gate.

I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from
between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that
time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his
pink suit under the moon.

"What are you doing?" I inquired.

"Just standing here, old sport."

Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going
to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see
sinister faces, the faces of "Wolfsheim's people," behind him in the
dark shrubbery.

"Did you see any trouble on the road?" he asked after a minute.

"Yes."

He hesitated.

"Was she killed?"

"Yes."

"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock
should all come at once. She stood it pretty well."

He spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.

"I got to West Egg by a side road," he went on, "and left the car in my
garage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure."

I disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to
tell him he was wrong.

"Who was the woman?" he inquired.

"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it
happen?"

"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----" He broke off, and suddenly I
guessed at the truth.

"Was Daisy driving?"

"Yes," he said after a moment, "but of course I'll say I was. You see,
when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would
steady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were
passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it
seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody
she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other
car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand
reached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly."

"It ripped her open----"

"Don't tell me, old sport." He winced. "Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.
I tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency
brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.

"She'll be all right tomorrow," he said presently. "I'm just going to
wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness
this afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any
brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again."

"He won't touch her," I said. "He's not thinking about her."

"I don't trust him, old sport."

"How long are you going to wait?"

"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed."

A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had
been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think
anything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows
downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.

"You wait here," I said. "I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion."

I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly
and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open,
and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined
that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light
which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found
a rift at the sill.

Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table
with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of
ale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his
earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a
while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.

They weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the
ale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air
of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that
they were conspiring together.

As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the
dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in
the drive.

"Is it all quiet up there?" he asked anxiously.

"Yes, it's all quiet." I hesitated. "You'd better come home and get
some sleep."

He shook his head.

"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport."

He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his
scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of
the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the
moonlight--watching over nothing.

I couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the
Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage
frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive
and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I
had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning
would be too late.

Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was
leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.

"Nothing happened," he said wanly. "I waited, and about four o'clock she
came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out
the light."

His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we
hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains
that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for
electric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the
keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust
everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for
many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry
cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the
drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.

"You ought to go away," I said. "It's pretty certain they'll trace
your car."

"Go away NOW, old sport?"

"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal."

He wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew
what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I
couldn't bear to shake him free.

It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with
Dan Cody--told it to me because "Jay Gatsby" had broken up like glass
against Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played
out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without
reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.

She was the first "nice" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed
capacities he had come in contact with such people but always
with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly
desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers
from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been
in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless
intensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her
as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,
a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other
bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its
corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in
lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining
motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It
excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased
her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,
pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.

But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.
However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a
penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible
cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made
the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and
unscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night,
took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.

He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under
false pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom
millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he
let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as
herself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of
fact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing
behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government
to be blown anywhere about the world.

But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had
imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but
now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.
He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how
extraordinary a "nice" girl could be. She vanished into her rich
house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt
married to her, that was all.

When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless,
who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought
luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably
as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.
She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming
than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery
that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes
and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot
struggles of the poor.


"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,
old sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she
didn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot
because I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was,
way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and
all of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great
things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going
to do?"

On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in
his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire
in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he
changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The
afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep
memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been
closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one
with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's
shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though
she were asleep.


He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went
to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and
the command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice
he tried frantically to get home but some complication or
misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there
was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why
he couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside
and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be
reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.

For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids
and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of
the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new
tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the
"Beale Street Blues" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver
slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were
always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever,
while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the
sad horns around the floor.

Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the
season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with
half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and
chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor
beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a
decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision
must be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable
practicality--that was close at hand.

That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom
Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his
position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain
struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was
still at Oxford.


It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of
the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning,
gold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew
and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a
slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool
lovely day.

"I don't think she ever loved him." Gatsby turned around from a window
and looked at me challengingly. "You must remember, old sport, she was
very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that
frightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.
And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying."

He sat down gloomily.

"Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were
first married--and loved me more even then, do you see?"

Suddenly he came out with a curious remark:

"In any case," he said, "it was just personal."

What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in
his conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?

He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding
trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville
on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the
streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the
November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which
they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always
seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his
idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded
with a melancholy beauty.

He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found
her--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless
now--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a
folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar
buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow
trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have
seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.

The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it
sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing
city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand
desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of
the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too
fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of
it, the freshest and the best, forever.


It was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the
porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there
was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's
former servants, came to the foot of the steps.

"I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling
pretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes."

"Don't do it today," Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.
"You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?"

I looked at my watch and stood up.

"Twelve minutes to my train."

I didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work
but it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that
train, and then another, before I could get myself away.

"I'll call you up," I said finally.

"Do, old sport."

"I'll call you about noon."

We walked slowly down the steps.

"I suppose Daisy'll call too." He looked at me anxiously as if he
hoped I'd corroborate this.

"I suppose so."

"Well--goodbye."

We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I
remembered something and turned around.

"They're a rotten crowd," I shouted across the lawn. "You're worth the
whole damn bunch put together."

I've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave
him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded
politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding
smile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.
His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the
white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral
home three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the
faces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those
steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.

I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for
that--I and the others.

"Goodbye," I called. "I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby."


Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an
interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.
Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat
breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called
me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements
between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find
in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something
fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come
sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.

"I've left Daisy's house," she said. "I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down
to Southampton this afternoon."

Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act
annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.

"You weren't so nice to me last night."

"How could it have mattered then?"

Silence for a moment. Then--

"However--I want to see you."

"I want to see you too."

"Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?"

"No--I don't think this afternoon."

"Very well."

"It's impossible this afternoon. Various----"

We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any
longer. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I
didn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if
I never talked to her again in this world.

I called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I
tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was
being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my
time-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I
leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.


When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed
deliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a
curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark
spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what
had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he
could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was
forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the
garage after we left there the night before.

They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must
have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she
arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the
ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of
this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of
the affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove
her in the wake of her sister's body.

Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front
of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the
couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and
everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.
Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and
several other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or
three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait
there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made
a pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.

About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering
changed--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He
announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged
to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had
come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.

But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry "Oh,
my God!" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt
to distract him.

"How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit
still a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?"

"Twelve years."

"Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a
question. Did you ever have any children?"

The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever
Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him
like the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go
into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had
been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every
object in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson
trying to keep him more quiet.

"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you
haven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church
and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?"

"Don't belong to any."

"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have
gone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George,
listen to me. Didn't you get married in a church?"

"That was a long time ago."

The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he
was silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back
into his faded eyes.

"Look in the drawer there," he said, pointing at the desk.

"Which drawer?"

"That drawer--that one."

Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but
a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was
apparently new.

"This?" he inquired, holding it up.

Wilson stared and nodded.

"I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I
knew it was something funny."

"You mean your wife bought it?"

"She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau."

Michaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen
reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably
Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,
because he began saying "Oh, my God!" again in a whisper--his comforter
left several explanations in the air.

"Then he killed her," said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.

"Who did?"

"I have a way of finding out."

"You're morbid, George," said his friend. "This has been a strain to you
and you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet
till morning."

"He murdered her."

"It was an accident, George."

Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly
with the ghost of a superior "Hm!"

"I know," he said definitely, "I'm one of these trusting fellas and I
don't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know
it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he
wouldn't stop."

Michaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was
any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been
running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any
particular car.

"How could she of been like that?"

"She's a deep one," said Wilson, as if that answered the question.
"Ah-h-h----"

He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in
his hand.

"Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?"

This was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:
there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when
he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and
realized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough
outside to snap off the light.

Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey
clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint
dawn wind.

"I spoke to her," he muttered, after a long silence. "I told her she might
fool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--" With an
effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face
pressed against it, "--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing,
everything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' "

Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the
eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous
from the dissolving night.

"God sees everything," repeated Wilson.

"That's an advertisement," Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn
away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a
long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.


By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a
car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before
who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which
he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis
went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the
garage Wilson was gone.

His movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port
Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he
didn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking
slowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was
no difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a
man "acting sort of crazy" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from
the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view.
The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he "had
a way of finding out," supposed that he spent that time going from
garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other
hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he
had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By
half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to
Gatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.


At two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the
butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the
pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused
his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.
Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out
under any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right
fender needed repair.

Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he
stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he
needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among
the yellowing trees.

No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and
waited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to
give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't
believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true
he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high
price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up
at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he
found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was
upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being
real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted
fortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward
him through the amorphous trees.

The chauffeur--he was one of Wolfsheim's protÃ©gÃ©s--heard the
shots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much
about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my
rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any
one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four
of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.

There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the
fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.
With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden
mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that
scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental
course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves
revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle
in the water.

It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener
saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was
complete.



After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the
next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and
newspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched
across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but
little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and
there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.
Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the
expression "mad man" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and
the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper
reports next morning.

Most of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial,
eager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to
light Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would
shortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have
said anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of
character about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under
that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen
Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her
sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it
and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more
than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man "deranged by
grief" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And
it rested there.

But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on
Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of
the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and
every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and
confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or
speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no
one else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal
interest to which every one has some vague right at the end.

I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her
instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away
early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.

"Left no address?"

"No."

"Say when they'd be back?"

"No."

"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?"

"I don't know. Can't say."

I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he
lay and reassure him: "I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry.
Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you----"

Meyer Wolfsheim's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his
office address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I
had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.

"Will you ring again?"

"I've rung them three times."

"It's very important."

"Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there."

I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were
chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But
as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes,
his protest continued in my brain.

"Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got
to try hard. I can't go through this alone."

Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs
looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me
definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the
picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from
the wall.

Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfsheim
which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next
train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd
start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire
from Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived, no
one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.
When the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a
feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me
against them all.


_Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my
life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad
act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as
I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in
this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me
know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a
thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.

                                        Yours truly
                                                      MEYER Wolfsheim_

and then hasty addenda beneath:

_Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._


When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was
calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came
through as a man's voice, very thin and far away.

"This is Slagle speaking. . . ."

"Yes?" The name was unfamiliar.

"Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?"

"There haven't been any wires."

"Young Parke's in trouble," he said rapidly. "They picked him up when he
handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York
giving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about
that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----"

"Hello!" I interrupted breathlessly. "Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby.
Mr. Gatsby's dead."

There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an
exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.


I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz
arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was
leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.

It was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed,
bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His
eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and
umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse
grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the
point of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit
down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the
glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.

"I saw it in the Chicago newspaper," he said. "It was all in the Chicago
newspaper. I started right away."

"I didn't know how to reach you."

His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.

"It was a mad man," he said. "He must have been mad."

"Wouldn't you like some coffee?" I urged him.

"I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----"

"Carraway."

"Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?"

I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.
Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall;
when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.

After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth
ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and
unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the
quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the
first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great
rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed
with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took
off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been
deferred until he came.

"I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----"

"Gatz is my name."

"--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west."

He shook his head.

"Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in
the East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?"

"We were close friends."

"He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but
he had a lot of brain power here."

He touched his head impressively and I nodded.

"If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill.
He'd of helped build up the country."

"That's true," I said, uncomfortably.

He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed,
and lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.

That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know
who I was before he would give his name.

"This is Mr. Carraway," I said.

"Oh--" He sounded relieved. "This is Klipspringer."

I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend
at Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw
a sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself.
They were hard to find.

"The funeral's tomorrow," I said. "Three o'clock, here at the house.
I wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested."

"Oh, I will," he broke out hastily. "Of course I'm not likely to see
anybody, but if I do."

His tone made me suspicious.

"Of course you'll be there yourself."

"Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----"

"Wait a minute," I interrupted. "How about saying you'll come?"

"Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with
some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with
them tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something.
Of course I'll do my very best to get away."

I ejaculated an unrestrained "Huh!" and he must have heard me for he went
on nervously:

"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if
it'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You
see they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My
address is care of B. F.----"

I didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.

After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I
telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was
my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at
Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known
better than to call him.

The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer
Wolfsheim; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I
pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked "The Swastika
Holding Company" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside.
But when I'd shouted "Hello" several times in vain an argument broke
out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an
interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.

"Nobody's in," she said. "Mr. Wolfsheim's gone to Chicago."

The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to
whistle "The Rosary," tunelessly, inside.

"Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him."

"I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?"

At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim's called "Stella!"
from the other side of the door.

"Leave your name on the desk," she said quickly. "I'll give it to him
when he gets back."

"But I know he's there."

She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up
and down her hips.

"You young men think you can force your way in here any time," she
scolded. "We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago,
he's in ChiCAgo."

I mentioned Gatsby.

"Oh--h!" She looked at me over again. "Will you just--what was your name?"

She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway,
holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a
reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me
a cigar.

"My memory goes back to when I first met him," he said. "A young
major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got
in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform
because he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was
when he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and
asked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on
have some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of
food in half an hour."

"Did you start him in business?" I inquired.

"Start him! I made him."

"Oh."

"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right
away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told
me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up
in the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he
did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like
that in everything--" He held up two bulbous fingers "--always
together."

I wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction
in 1919.

"Now he's dead," I said after a moment. "You were his closest friend,
so I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon."

"I'd like to come."

"Well, come then."

The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his
eyes filled with tears.

"I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it," he said.

"There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now."

"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.
I keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine
died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's
sentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end."

I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,
so I stood up.

"Are you a college man?" he inquired suddenly.

For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a "gonnegtion" but he
only nodded and shook my hand.

"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not
after he is dead," he suggested. "After that my own rule is to let
everything alone."

When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg
in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found
Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his
son and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he
had something to show me.

"Jimmy sent me this picture." He took out his wallet with trembling
fingers. "Look there."

It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with
many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. "Look there!" and
then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think
it was more real to him now than the house itself.

"Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up
well."

"Very well. Had you seen him lately?"

"He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in
now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now
there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him.
And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me."

He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute,
lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from
his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called "Hopalong Cassidy."

"Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows
you."

He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.
On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date

"I come across this book by accident," said the old man. "It just shows
you, don't it?"

"It just shows you."

"Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or
something. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was
always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him
for it."

He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then
looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the
list for my own use.

A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and
I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did
Gatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and
stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he
spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced
several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait
for half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.


About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery
and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse,
horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the
limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman
from West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we
started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then
the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked
around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found
marvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months
before.

I'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the
funeral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and
he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled
from Gatsby's grave.

I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too
far away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy
hadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur
"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on," and then the owl-eyed
man said "Amen to that," in a brave voice.

We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke
to me by the gate.

"I couldn't get to the house," he remarked.

"Neither could anybody else."

"Go on!" He started. "Why, my God! they used to go there by the
hundreds."

He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.

"The poor son-of-a-bitch," he said.


One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school
and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than
Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a
December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into
their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember
the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and
the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as
we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations:
"Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?"
and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.
And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside
the gate.

When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,
began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the
dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace
came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked
back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our
identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted
indistinguishably into it again.

That's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede
towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street
lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly
wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a
little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent
from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are
still called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this
has been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and
Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some
deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.

Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware
of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the
Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the
children and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of
distortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic
dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at
once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging
sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress
suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a
drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over
the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a
house--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one
cares.

After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted
beyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle
leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the
line I decided to come back home.

There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant
thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to
leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent
sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and
around what had happened to us together and what had happened
afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big
chair.

She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a
good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the
color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless
glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that
she was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were
several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to
be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a
mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say
goodbye.

"Nevertheless you did throw me over," said Jordan suddenly. "You threw me
over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a
new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while."

We shook hands.

"Oh, and do you remember--" she added, "----a conversation we had once
about driving a car?"

"Why--not exactly."

"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?
Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me
to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,
straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride."

"I'm thirty," I said. "I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call
it honor."

She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously
sorry, I turned away.


One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead
of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a
little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving
sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I
slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into
the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back
holding out his hand.

"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?"

"Yes. You know what I think of you."

"You're crazy, Nick," he said quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't know
what's the matter with you."

"Tom," I inquired, "what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?"

He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about
those missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me
and grabbed my arm.

"I told him the truth," he said. "He came to the door while we were
getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he
tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I
hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his
pocket every minute he was in the house----" He broke off defiantly.
"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw
dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough
one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped
his car."

There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact
that it wasn't true.

"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I
went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting
there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it
was awful----"

I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was,
to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused.
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and
creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast
carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other
people clean up the mess they had made. . . .

I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as
though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to
buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my
provincial squeamishness forever.


Gatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had
grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never
took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and
pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to
East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story
about it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I
got off the train.

I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling
parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the
music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the
cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car
there and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't
investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the
ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.

On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,
I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once
more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a
piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it,
drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the
beach and sprawled out on the sand.

Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any
lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.
And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away
until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered
once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world.
Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had
once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;
for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the
presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation
he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in
history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.

And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of
Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of
Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must
have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not
know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under
the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by
year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow
we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine
morning----

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
the past.

On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way between
Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud, rose-
colored hotel.  Deferential palms cool its flushed faÃ§ade, and
before it stretches a short dazzling beach.  Lately it has become a
summer resort of notable and fashionable people; a decade ago it
was almost deserted after its English clientele went north in
April.  Now, many bungalows cluster near it, but when this story
begins only the cupolas of a dozen old villas rotted like water
lilies among the massed pines between Gausse's HÃ´tel des Ãtrangers
and Cannes, five miles away.

The hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were one.  In
the early morning the distant image of Cannes, the pink and cream
of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy, were cast
across the water and lay quavering in the ripples and rings sent up
by sea-plants through the clear shallows.  Before eight a man came
down to the beach in a blue bathrobe and with much preliminary
application to his person of the chilly water, and much grunting
and loud breathing, floundered a minute in the sea.  When he had
gone, beach and bay were quiet for an hour.  Merchantmen crawled
westward on the horizon; bus boys shouted in the hotel court; the
dew dried upon the pines.  In another hour the horns of motors
began to blow down from the winding road along the low range of the
Maures, which separates the littoral from true ProvenÃ§al France.

A mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty poplars, is an
isolated railroad stop, whence one June morning in 1925 a victoria
brought a woman and her daughter down to Gausse's Hotel.  The
mother's face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted
with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a
pleasant way.  However, one's eye moved on quickly to her daughter,
who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely
flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths
in the evening.  Her fine forehead sloped gently up to where her
hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks
and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold.  Her eyes were
bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was
real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of
her heart.  Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of
childhood--she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew
was still on her.

As sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line the mother
said:

"Something tells me we're not going to like this place."

"I want to go home anyhow," the girl answered.

They both spoke cheerfully but were obviously without direction and
bored by the fact--moreover, just any direction would not do.  They
wanted high excitement, not from the necessity of stimulating jaded
nerves but with the avidity of prize-winning schoolchildren who
deserved their vacations.

"We'll stay three days and then go home.  I'll wire right away for
steamer tickets."

At the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic but rather
flat French, like something remembered.  When they were installed
on the ground floor she walked into the glare of the French windows
and out a few steps onto the stone veranda that ran the length of
the hotel.  When she walked she carried herself like a ballet-
dancer, not slumped down on her hips but held up in the small of
her back.  Out there the hot light clipped close her shadow and she
retreated--it was too bright to see.  Fifty yards away the
Mediterranean yielded up its pigments, moment by moment, to the
brutal sunshine; below the balustrade a faded Buick cooked on the
hotel drive.

Indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with activity.
Three British nannies sat knitting the slow pattern of Victorian
England, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, and the eighties,
into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip as formalized as
incantation; closer to the sea a dozen persons kept house under
striped umbrellas, while their dozen children pursued unintimidated
fish through the shallows or lay naked and glistening with cocoanut
oil out in the sun.

As Rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran past her and
dashed into the sea with exultant cries.  Feeling the impactive
scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her bathrobe and followed.
She floated face down for a few yards and finding it shallow
staggered to her feet and plodded forward, dragging slim legs like
weights against the resistance of the water.  When it was about
breast high, she glanced back toward shore: a bald man in a monocle
and a pair of tights, his tufted chest thrown out, his brash navel
sucked in, was regarding her attentively.  As Rosemary returned the
gaze the man dislodged the monocle, which went into hiding amid the
facetious whiskers of his chest, and poured himself a glass of
something from a bottle in his hand.

Rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppy little four-
beat crawl out to the raft.  The water reached up for her, pulled
her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her hair and ran into
the corners of her body.  She turned round and round in it,
embracing it, wallowing in it.  Reaching the raft she was out of
breath, but a tanned woman with very white teeth looked down at
her, and Rosemary, suddenly conscious of the raw whiteness of her
own body, turned on her back and drifted toward shore.  The hairy
man holding the bottle spoke to her as she came out.

"I say--they have sharks out behind the raft."  He was of
indeterminate nationality, but spoke English with a slow Oxford
drawl.  "Yesterday they devoured two British sailors from the
flotte at Golfe Juan."

"Heavens!" exclaimed Rosemary.

"They come in for the refuse from the flotte."

Glazing his eyes to indicate that he had only spoken in order to
warn her, he minced off two steps and poured himself another drink.

Not unpleasantly self-conscious, since there had been a slight sway
of attention toward her during this conversation, Rosemary looked
for a place to sit.  Obviously each family possessed the strip of
sand immediately in front of its umbrella; besides there was much
visiting and talking back and forth--the atmosphere of a community
upon which it would be presumptuous to intrude.  Farther up, where
the beach was strewn with pebbles and dead sea-weed, sat a group
with flesh as white as her own.  They lay under small hand-parasols
instead of beach umbrellas and were obviously less indigenous to
the place.  Between the dark people and the light, Rosemary found
room and spread out her peignoir on the sand.

Lying so, she first heard their voices and felt their feet skirt
her body and their shapes pass between the sun and herself.  The
breath of an inquisitive dog blew warm and nervous on her neck; she
could feel her skin broiling a little in the heat and hear the
small exhausted wa-waa of the expiring waves.  Presently her ear
distinguished individual voices and she became aware that some one
referred to scornfully as "that North guy" had kidnapped a waiter
from a cafÃ© in Cannes last night in order to saw him in two.  The
sponsor of the story was a white-haired woman in full evening
dress, obviously a relic of the previous evening, for a tiara still
clung to her head and a discouraged orchid expired from her
shoulder.  Rosemary, forming a vague antipathy to her and her
companions, turned away.

Nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under a roof of
umbrellas making out a list of things from a book open on the sand.
Her bathing suit was pulled off her shoulders and her back, a
ruddy, orange brown, set off by a string of creamy pearls, shone in
the sun.  Her face was hard and lovely and pitiful.  Her eyes met
Rosemary's but did not see her.  Beyond her was a fine man in a
jockey cap and red-striped tights; then the woman Rosemary had seen
on the raft, and who looked back at her, seeing her; then a man
with a long face and a golden, leonine head, with blue tights and
no hat, talking very seriously to an unmistakably Latin young man
in black tights, both of them picking at little pieces of seaweed
in the sand.  She thought they were mostly Americans, but something
made them unlike the Americans she had known of late.

After a while she realized that the man in the jockey cap was
giving a quiet little performance for this group; he moved gravely
about with a rake, ostensibly removing gravel and meanwhile
developing some esoteric burlesque held in suspension by his grave
face.  Its faintest ramification had become hilarious, until
whatever he said released a burst of laughter.  Even those who,
like herself, were too far away to hear, sent out antennÃ¦ of
attention until the only person on the beach not caught up in it
was the young woman with the string of pearls.  Perhaps from
modesty of possession she responded to each salvo of amusement by
bending closer over her list.

The man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out of the sky
above Rosemary.

"You are a ripping swimmer."

She demurred.

"Jolly good.  My name is Campion.  Here is a lady who says she saw
you in Sorrento last week and knows who you are and would so like
to meet you."

Glancing around with concealed annoyance Rosemary saw the untanned
people were waiting.  Reluctantly she got up and went over to them.

"Mrs. Abrams--Mrs. McKisco--Mr. McKisco--Mr. Dumphry--

"We know who you are," spoke up the woman in evening dress.
"You're Rosemary Hoyt and I recognized you in Sorrento and asked
the hotel clerk and we all think you're perfectly marvellous and we
want to know why you're not back in America making another
marvellous moving picture."

They made a superfluous gesture of moving over for her.  The woman
who had recognized her was not a Jewess, despite her name.  She was
one of those elderly "good sports" preserved by an imperviousness
to experience and a good digestion into another generation.

"We wanted to warn you about getting burned the first day," she
continued cheerily, "because YOUR skin is important, but there
seems to be so darn much formality on this beach that we didn't
know whether you'd mind."

"We thought maybe you were in the plot," said Mrs. McKisco.  She
was a shabby-eyed, pretty young woman with a disheartening
intensity.  "We don't know who's in the plot and who isn't.  One
man my husband had been particularly nice to turned out to be a
chief character--practically the assistant hero."

"The plot?" inquired Rosemary, half understanding.  "Is there a
plot?"

"My dear, we don't KNOW," said Mrs. Abrams, with a convulsive,
stout woman's chuckle.  "We're not in it.  We're the gallery."

Mr. Dumphry, a tow-headed effeminate young man, remarked:  "Mama
Abrams is a plot in herself," and Campion shook his monocle at him,
saying:  "Now, Royal, don't be too ghastly for words."  Rosemary
looked at them all uncomfortably, wishing her mother had come down
here with her.  She did not like these people, especially in her
immediate comparison of them with those who had interested her at
the other end of the beach.  Her mother's modest but compact social
gift got them out of unwelcome situations swiftly and firmly.  But
Rosemary had been a celebrity for only six months, and sometimes
the French manners of her early adolescence and the democratic
manners of America, these latter superimposed, made a certain
confusion and let her in for just such things.

Mr. McKisco, a scrawny, freckle-and-red man of thirty, did not find
the topic of the "plot" amusing.  He had been staring at the sea--
now after a swift glance at his wife he turned to Rosemary and
demanded aggressively:

"Been here long?"

"Only a day."

"Oh."

Evidently feeling that the subject had been thoroughly changed, he
looked in turn at the others.

"Going to stay all summer?" asked Mrs. McKisco, innocently.  "If
you do you can watch the plot unfold."

"For God's sake, Violet, drop the subject!" exploded her husband.
"Get a new joke, for God's sake!"

Mrs. McKisco swayed toward Mrs. Abrams and breathed audibly:

"He's nervous."

"I'm not nervous," disagreed McKisco.  "It just happens I'm not
nervous at all."

He was burning visibly--a grayish flush had spread over his face,
dissolving all his expressions into a vast ineffectuality.
Suddenly remotely conscious of his condition he got up to go in the
water, followed by his wife, and seizing the opportunity Rosemary
followed.

Mr. McKisco drew a long breath, flung himself into the shallows and
began a stiff-armed batting of the Mediterranean, obviously
intended to suggest a crawl--his breath exhausted he arose and
looked around with an expression of surprise that he was still in
sight of shore.

"I haven't learned to breathe yet.  I never quite understood how
they breathed."  He looked at Rosemary inquiringly.

"I think you breathe out under water," she explained.  "And every
fourth beat you roll your head over for air."

"The breathing's the hardest part for me.  Shall we go to the
raft?"

The man with the leonine head lay stretched out upon the raft,
which tipped back and forth with the motion of the water.  As Mrs.
McKisco reached for it a sudden tilt struck her arm up roughly,
whereupon the man started up and pulled her on board.

"I was afraid it hit you."  His voice was slow and shy; he had one
of the saddest faces Rosemary had ever seen, the high cheekbones of
an Indian, a long upper lip, and enormous deep-set dark golden
eyes.  He had spoken out of the side of his mouth, as if he hoped
his words would reach Mrs. McKisco by a circuitous and unobtrusive
route; in a minute he had shoved off into the water and his long
body lay motionless toward shore.

Rosemary and Mrs. McKisco watched him.  When he had exhausted his
momentum he abruptly bent double, his thin thighs rose above the
surface, and he disappeared totally, leaving scarcely a fleck of
foam behind.

"He's a good swimmer," Rosemary said.

Mrs. McKisco's answer came with surprising violence.

"Well, he's a rotten musician."  She turned to her husband, who
after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climb on the raft,
and having attained his balance was trying to make some kind of
compensatory flourish, achieving only an extra stagger.  "I was
just saying that Abe North may be a good swimmer but he's a rotten
musician."

"Yes," agreed McKisco, grudgingly.  Obviously he had created his
wife's world, and allowed her few liberties in it.

"Antheil's my man."  Mrs. McKisco turned challengingly to Rosemary,
"Anthiel and Joyce.  I don't suppose you ever hear much about those
sort of people in Hollywood, but my husband wrote the first
criticism of Ulysses that ever appeared in America."

"I wish I had a cigarette," said McKisco calmly.  "That's more
important to me just now."

"He's got insides--don't you think so, Albert?"

Her voice faded off suddenly.  The woman of the pearls had joined
her two children in the water, and now Abe North came up under one
of them like a volcanic island, raising him on his shoulders.  The
child yelled with fear and delight and the woman watched with a
lovely peace, without a smile.

"Is that his wife?" Rosemary asked.

"No, that's Mrs. Diver.  They're not at the hotel."  Her eyes,
photographic, did not move from the woman's face.  After a moment
she turned vehemently to Rosemary.

"Have you been abroad before?"

"Yes--I went to school in Paris."

"Oh!  Well then you probably know that if you want to enjoy
yourself here the thing is to get to know some real French
families.  What do these people get out of it?"  She pointed her
left shoulder toward shore.  "They just stick around with each
other in little cliques.  Of course, we had letters of introduction
and met all the best French artists and writers in Paris.  That
made it very nice."

"I should think so."

"My husband is finishing his first novel, you see."

Rosemary said:  "Oh, he is?"  She was not thinking anything
special, except wondering whether her mother had got to sleep in
this heat.

"It's on the idea of Ulysses," continued Mrs. McKisco.  "Only
instead of taking twenty-four hours my husband takes a hundred
years.  He takes a decayed old French aristocrat and puts him in
contrast with the mechanical age--"

"Oh, for God's sake, Violet, don't go telling everybody the idea,"
protested McKisco.  "I don't want it to get all around before the
book's published."

Rosemary swam back to the shore, where she threw her peignoir over
her already sore shoulders and lay down again in the sun.  The man
with the jockey cap was now going from umbrella to umbrella
carrying a bottle and little glasses in his hands; presently he and
his friends grew livelier and closer together and now they were all
under a single assemblage of umbrellas--she gathered that some one
was leaving and that this was a last drink on the beach.  Even the
children knew that excitement was generating under that umbrella
and turned toward it--and it seemed to Rosemary that it all came
from the man in the jockey cap.

Noon dominated sea and sky--even the white line of Cannes, five
miles off, had faded to a mirage of what was fresh and cool; a
robin-breasted sailing boat pulled in behind it a strand from the
outer, darker sea.  It seemed that there was no life anywhere in
all this expanse of coast except under the filtered sunlight of
those umbrellas, where something went on amid the color and the
murmur.

Campion walked near her, stood a few feet away and Rosemary closed
her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then she half-opened them and
watched two dim, blurred pillars that were legs.  The man tried to
edge his way into a sand-colored cloud, but the cloud floated off
into the vast hot sky.  Rosemary fell really asleep.

She awoke drenched with sweat to find the beach deserted save for
the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last umbrella.  As
Rosemary lay blinking, he walked nearer and said:

"I was going to wake you before I left.  It's not good to get too
burned right away."

"Thank you."  Rosemary looked down at her crimson legs.

"Heavens!"

She laughed cheerfully, inviting him to talk, but Dick Diver was
already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up to a waiting car,
so she went into the water to wash off the sweat.  He came back and
gathering up a rake, a shovel, and a sieve, stowed them in a
crevice of a rock.  He glanced up and down the beach to see if he
had left anything.

"Do you know what time it is?" Rosemary asked.

"It's about half-past one."

They faced the seascape together momentarily.

"It's not a bad time," said Dick Diver.  "It's not one of worst
times of the day."

He looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright blue
worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently.  Then he shouldered
his last piece of junk and went up to his car, and Rosemary came
out of the water, shook out her peignoir and walked up to the
hotel.


It was almost two when they went into the dining-room.  Back and
forth over the deserted tables a heavy pattern of beams and shadows
swayed with the motion of the pines outside.  Two waiters, piling
plates and talking loud Italian, fell silent when they came in and
brought them a tired version of the table d'hÃ´te luncheon.

"I fell in love on the beach," said Rosemary.

"Who with?"

"First with a whole lot of people who looked nice.  Then with one
man."

"Did you talk to him?"

"Just a little.  Very handsome.  With reddish hair."  She was
eating, ravenously.  "He's married though--it's usually the way."

Her mother was her best friend and had put every last possibility
into the guiding of her, not so rare a thing in the theatrical
profession, but rather special in that Mrs. Elsie Speers was not
recompensing herself for a defeat of her own.  She had no personal
bitterness or resentments about life--twice satisfactorily married
and twice widowed, her cheerful stoicism had each time deepened.
One of her husbands had been a cavalry officer and one an army
doctor, and they both left something to her that she tried to
present intact to Rosemary.  By not sparing Rosemary she had made
her hard--by not sparing her own labor and devotion she had
cultivated an idealism in Rosemary, which at present was directed
toward herself and saw the world through her eyes.  So that while
Rosemary was a "simple" child she was protected by a double sheath
of her mother's armor and her own--she had a mature distrust of the
trivial, the facile and the vulgar.  However, with Rosemary's
sudden success in pictures Mrs. Speers felt that it was time she
were spiritually weaned; it would please rather than pain her if
this somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would focus
on something except herself.

"Then you like it here?" she asked.

"It might be fun if we knew those people.  There were some other
people, but they weren't nice.  They recognized me--no matter where
we go everybody's seen 'Daddy's Girl.'"

Mrs. Speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside; then she
said in a matter-of-fact way:  "That reminds me, when are you going
to see Earl Brady?"

"I thought we might go this afternoon--if you're rested."

"You go--I'm not going."

"We'll wait till to-morrow then."

"I want you to go alone.  It's only a short way--it isn't as if you
didn't speak French."

"Mother--aren't there some things I don't have to do?"

"Oh, well then go later--but some day before we leave."

"All right, Mother."

After lunch they were both overwhelmed by the sudden flatness that
comes over American travellers in quiet foreign places.  No stimuli
worked upon them, no voices called them from without, no fragments
of their own thoughts came suddenly from the minds of others, and
missing the clamor of Empire they felt that life was not continuing
here.

"Let's only stay three days, Mother," Rosemary said when they were
back in their rooms.  Outside a light wind blew the heat around,
straining it through the trees and sending little hot gusts through
the shutters.

"How about the man you fell in love with on the beach?"

"I don't love anybody but you, Mother, darling."

Rosemary stopped in the lobby and spoke to Gausse pÃ¨re about
trains.  The concierge, lounging in light-brown khaki by the desk,
stared at her rigidly, then suddenly remembered the manners of his
mÃ©tier.  She took the bus and rode with a pair of obsequious
waiters to the station, embarrassed by their deferential silence,
wanting to urge them:  "Go on, talk, enjoy yourselves.  It doesn't
bother me."

The first-class compartment was stifling; the vivid advertising
cards of the railroad companies--The Pont du Gard at Arles, the
Amphitheatre at Orange, winter sports at Chamonix--were fresher
than the long motionless sea outside.  Unlike American trains that
were absorbed in an intense destiny of their own, and scornful of
people on another world less swift and breathless, this train was
part of the country through which it passed.  Its breath stirred
the dust from the palm leaves, the cinders mingled with the dry
dung in the gardens.  Rosemary was sure she could lean from the
window and pull flowers with her hand.

A dozen cabbies slept in their hacks outside the Cannes station.
Over on the promenade the Casino, the smart shops, and the great
hotels turned blank iron masks to the summer sea.  It was
unbelievable that there could ever have been a "season," and
Rosemary, half in the grip of fashion, became a little self-
conscious, as though she were displaying an unhealthy taste for the
moribund; as though people were wondering why she was here in the
lull between the gaiety of last winter and next winter, while up
north the true world thundered by.



As she came out of a drug store with a bottle of cocoanut oil, a
woman, whom she recognized as Mrs. Diver, crossed her path with
arms full of sofa cushions, and went to a car parked down the
street.  A long, low black dog barked at her, a dozing chauffeur
woke with a start.  She sat in the car, her lovely face set,
controlled, her eyes brave and watchful, looking straight ahead
toward nothing.  Her dress was bright red and her brown legs were
bare.  She had thick, dark, gold hair like a chow's.

With half an hour to wait for her train Rosemary sat down in the
CafÃ© des AlliÃ©s on the Croisette, where the trees made a green
twilight over the tables and an orchestra wooed an imaginary public
of cosmopolites with the Nice Carnival Song and last year's
American tune.  She had bought Le Temps and The Saturday Evening
Post for her mother, and as she drank her citronade she opened the
latter at the memoirs of a Russian princess, finding the dim
conventions of the nineties realer and nearer than the headlines of
the French paper.  It was the same feeling that had oppressed her
at the hotel--accustomed to seeing the starkest grotesqueries of a
continent heavily underlined as comedy or tragedy, untrained to the
task of separating out the essential for herself, she now began to
feel that French life was empty and stale.  This feeling was
surcharged by listening to the sad tunes of the orchestra,
reminiscent of the melancholy music played for acrobats in
vaudeville.  She was glad to go back to Gausse's Hotel.

Her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next day, so she and
her mother hired a car--after much haggling, for Rosemary had
formed her valuations of money in France--and drove along the
Riviera, the delta of many rivers.  The chauffeur, a Russian Czar
of the period of Ivan the Terrible, was a self-appointed guide, and
the resplendent names--Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo--began to glow
through their torpid camouflage, whispering of old kings come here
to dine or die, of rajahs tossing Buddha's eyes to English
ballerinas, of Russian princes turning the weeks into Baltic
twilights in the lost caviare days.  Most of all, there was the
scent of the Russians along the coast--their closed book shops and
grocery stores.  Ten years ago, when the season ended in April, the
doors of the Orthodox Church were locked, and the sweet champagnes
they favored were put away until their return.  "We'll be back next
season," they said, but this was premature, for they were never
coming back any more.

It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon,
above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates and cornelians of
childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry water, wine dark.
It was pleasant to pass people eating outside their doors, and to
hear the fierce mechanical pianos behind the vines of country
estaminets.  When they turned off the Corniche d'Or and down to
Gausse's Hotel through the darkening banks of trees, set one behind
another in many greens, the moon already hovered over the ruins of
the aqueducts. . . .

Somewhere in the hills behind the hotel there was a dance, and
Rosemary listened to the music through the ghostly moonshine of her
mosquito net, realizing that there was gaiety too somewhere about,
and she thought of the nice people on the beach.  She thought she
might meet them in the morning, but they obviously formed a self-
sufficient little group, and once their umbrellas, bamboo rugs,
dogs, and children were set out in place the part of the plage was
literally fenced in.  She resolved in any case not to spend her
last two mornings with the other ones.

The matter was solved for her.  The McKiscos were not yet there and
she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two men--the man with the
jockey cap and the tall blonde man, given to sawing waiters in two--
left the group and came down toward her.

"Good morning," said Dick Diver.  He broke down.  "Look--sunburn or
no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday?  We worried about
you."

She sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their intrusion.

"We wondered," Dick Diver said, "if you wouldn't come over this
morning.  We go in, we take food and drink, so it's a substantial
invitation."

He seemed kind and charming--his voice promised that he would take
care of her, and that a little later he would open up whole new
worlds for her, unroll an endless succession of magnificent
possibilities.  He managed the introduction so that her name wasn't
mentioned and then let her know easily that everyone knew who she
was but were respecting the completeness of her private life--a
courtesy that Rosemary had not met with save from professional
people since her success.

Nicole Diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls, was looking
through a recipe book for chicken Maryland.  She was about twenty-
four, Rosemary guessed--her face could have been described in terms
of conventional prettiness, but the effect was that it had been
made first on the heroic scale with strong structure and marking,
as if the features and vividness of brow and coloring, everything
we associate with temperament and character had been molded with a
Rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the direction of
prettiness to a point where a single slip would have irreparably
diminished its force and quality.  With the mouth the sculptor had
taken desperate chances--it was the cupid's bow of a magazine
cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest.

"Are you here for a long time?" Nicole asked.  Her voice was low,
almost harsh.

Suddenly Rosemary let the possibility enter her mind that they
might stay another week.

"Not very long," she answered vaguely.  "We've been abroad a long
time--we landed in Sicily in March and we've been slowly working
our way north.  I got pneumonia making a picture last January and
I've been recuperating."

"Mercy!  How did that happen?"

"Well, it was from swimming," Rosemary was rather reluctant at
embarking upon personal revelations.  "One day I happened to have
the grippe and didn't know it, and they were taking a scene where I
dove into a canal in Venice.  It was a very expensive set, so I had
to dive and dive and dive all morning.  Mother had a doctor right
there, but it was no use--I got pneumonia."  She changed the
subject determinedly before they could speak.  "Do you like it
here--this place?"

"They have to like it," said Abe North slowly.  "They invented it."
He turned his noble head slowly so that his eyes rested with
tenderness and affection on the two Divers.

"Oh, did you?"

"This is only the second season that the hotel's been open in
summer," Nicole explained.  "We persuaded Gausse to keep on a cook
and a garÃ§on and a chasseur--it paid its way and this year it's
doing even better."

"But you're not in the hotel."

"We built a house, up at Tarmes."

"The theory is," said Dick, arranging an umbrella to clip a square
of sunlight off Rosemary's shoulder, "that all the northern places,
like Deauville, were picked out by Russians and English who don't
mind the cold, while half of us Americans come from tropical
climates--that's why we're beginning to come here."

The young man of Latin aspect had been turning the pages of The New
York Herald.

"Well, what nationality are these people?" he demanded, suddenly,
and read with a slight French intonation, "'Registered at the Hotel
Palace at Vevey are Mr. Pandely Vlasco, Mme. Bonneasse'--I don't
exaggerate--'Corinna Medonca, Mme. Pasche, Seraphim Tullio, Maria
Amalia Roto Mais, Moises Teubel, Mme. Paragoris, Apostle Alexandre,
Yolanda Yosfuglu and Geneveva de Momus!'  She attracts me most--
Geneveva de Momus.  Almost worth running up to Vevey to take a look
at Geneveva de Momus."

He stood up with sudden restlessness, stretching himself with one
sharp movement.  He was a few years younger than Diver or North.
He was tall and his body was hard but overspare save for the
bunched force gathered in his shoulders and upper arms.  At first
glance he seemed conventionally handsome--but there was a faint
disgust always in his face which marred the full fierce lustre of
his brown eyes.  Yet one remembered them afterward, when one had
forgotten the inability of the mouth to endure boredom and the
young forehead with its furrows of fretful and unprofitable pain.

"We found some fine ones in the news of Americans last week," said
Nicole.  "Mrs. Evelyn Oyster and--what were the others?"

"There was Mr. S. Flesh," said Diver, getting up also.  He took his
rake and began to work seriously at getting small stones out of the
sand.

"Oh, yes--S. Flesh--doesn't he give you the creeps?"

It was quiet alone with Nicole--Rosemary found it even quieter than
with her mother.  Abe North and Barban, the Frenchman, were talking
about Morocco, and Nicole having copied her recipe picked up a
piece of sewing.  Rosemary examined their appurtenances--four large
parasols that made a canopy of shade, a portable bath house for
dressing, a pneumatic rubber horse, new things that Rosemary had
never seen, from the first burst of luxury manufacturing after the
War, and probably in the hands of the first of purchasers.  She had
gathered that they were fashionable people, but though her mother
had brought her up to beware such people as drones, she did not
feel that way here.  Even in their absolute immobility, complete as
that of the morning, she felt a purpose, a working over something,
a direction, an act of creation different from any she had known.
Her immature mind made no speculations upon the nature of their
relation to each other, she was only concerned with their attitude
toward herself--but she perceived the web of some pleasant
interrelation, which she expressed with the thought that they
seemed to have a very good time.

She looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriating
them.  All three were personable in different ways; all were of a
special gentleness that she felt was part of their lives, past and
future, not circumstanced by events, not at all like the company
manners of actors, and she detected also a far-reaching delicacy
that was different from the rough and ready good fellowship of
directors, who represented the intellectuals in her life.  Actors
and directors--those were the only men she had ever known, those
and the heterogeneous, indistinguishable mass of college boys,
interested only in love at first sight, whom she had met at the
Yale prom last fall.

These three were different.  Barban was less civilized, more
skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even perfunctory.
Abe North had, under his shyness, a desperate humor that amused but
puzzled her.  Her serious nature distrusted its ability to make a
supreme impression on him.

But Dick Diver--he was all complete there.  Silently she admired
him.  His complexion was reddish and weather-burned, so was his
short hair--a light growth of it rolled down his arms and hands.
His eyes were of a bright, hard blue.  His nose was somewhat
pointed and there was never any doubt at whom he was looking or
talking--and this is a flattering attention, for who looks at us?--
glances fall upon us, curious or disinterested, nothing more.  His
voice, with some faint Irish melody running through it, wooed the
world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control
and of self-discipline, her own virtues.  Oh, she chose him, and
Nicole, lifting her head saw her choose him, heard the little sigh
at the fact that he was already possessed.

Toward noon the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Signor
Campion came on the beach.  They had brought a new umbrella that
they set up with side glances toward the Divers, and crept under
with satisfied expressions--all save Mr. McKisco, who remained
derisively without.  In his raking Dick had passed near them and
now he returned to the umbrellas.

"The two young men are reading the Book of Etiquette together," he
said in a low voice.

"Planning to mix wit de quality," said Abe.

Mary North, the very tanned young woman whom Rosemary had
encountered the first day on the raft, came in from swimming and
said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:

"So Mr. and Mrs. Neverquiver have arrived."

"They're this man's friends," Nicole reminded her, indicating Abe.
"Why doesn't he go and speak to them?  Don't you think they're
attractive?"

"I think they're very attractive," Abe agreed.  "I just don't think
they're attractive, that's all."

"Well, I HAVE felt there were too many people on the beach this
summer," Nicole admitted.  "OUR beach that Dick made out of a
pebble pile."  She considered, and then lowering her voice out of
the range of the trio of nannies who sat back under another
umbrella.  "Still, they're preferable to those British last summer
who kept shouting about:  'Isn't the sea blue?  Isn't the sky
white?  Isn't little Nellie's nose red?'"

Rosemary thought she would not like to have Nicole for an enemy.

"But you didn't see the fight," Nicole continued.  "The day before
you came, the married man, the one with the name that sounds like a
substitute for gasoline or butter--"

"McKisco?"

"Yes--well they were having words and she tossed some sand in his
face.  So naturally he sat on top of her and rubbed her face in the
sand.  We were--electrified.  I wanted Dick to interfere."

"I think," said Dick Diver, staring down abstractedly at the straw
mat, "that I'll go over and invite them to dinner."

"No, you won't," Nicole told him quickly.

"I think it would be a very good thing.  They're here--let's adjust
ourselves."

"We're very well adjusted," she insisted, laughing.  "I'm not going
to have MY nose rubbed in the sand.  I'm a mean, hard woman," she
explained to Rosemary, and then raising her voice, "Children, put
on your bathing suits!"

Rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical one of her
life, the one that would always pop up in her memory at the mention
of swimming.  Simultaneously the whole party moved toward the
water, super-ready from the long, forced inaction, passing from the
heat to the cool with the gourmandise of a tingling curry eaten
with chilled white wine.  The Divers' day was spaced like the day
of the older civilizations to yield the utmost from the materials
at hand, and to give all the transitions their full value, and she
did not know that there would be another transition presently from
the utter absorption of the swim to the garrulity of the ProvenÃ§al
lunch hour.  But again she had the sense that Dick was taking care
of her, and she delighted in responding to the eventual movement as
if it had been an order.

Nicole handed her husband the curious garment on which she had been
working.  He went into the dressing tent and inspired a commotion
by appearing in a moment clad in transparent black lace drawers.
Close inspection revealed that actually they were lined with flesh-
colored cloth.



"Well, if that isn't a pansys trick!" exclaimed Mr. McKisco
contemptuously--then turning quickly to Mr. Dumphry and Mr.
Campion, he added, "Oh, I beg your pardon."

Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks.  Her naÃ¯vetÃ© responded
whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware
of its complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was
all a selection of quality rather than quantity from the run of the
world's bazaar; and that the simplicity of behavior also, the
nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis on the simpler
virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had been
attained through struggles she could not have guessed at.  At that
moment the Divers represented externally the exact furthermost
evolution of a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside
them--in reality a qualitative change had already set in that was
not at all apparent to Rosemary.

She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers.  Dick
Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strong mouth
said thoughtfully and deliberately:

"You're the only girl I've seen for a long time that actually did
look like something blooming."



In her mother's lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried.

"I love him, Mother.  I'm desperately in love with him--I never
knew I could feel that way about anybody.  And he's married and I
like her too--it's just hopeless.  Oh, I love him so!"

"I'm curious to meet him."

"She invited us to dinner Friday."

"If you're in love it ought to make you happy.  You ought to
laugh."

Rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of her face
and laughed.  Her mother always had a great influence on her.

Rosemary went to Monte Carlo nearly as sulkily as it was possible
for her to be.  She rode up the rugged hill to La Turbie, to an old
Gaumont lot in process of reconstruction, and as she stood by the
grilled entrance waiting for an answer to the message on her card,
she might have been looking into Hollywood.  The bizarre dÃ©bris of
some recent picture, a decayed street scene in India, a great
cardboard whale, a monstrous tree bearing cherries large as
basketballs, bloomed there by exotic dispensation, autochthonous as
the pale amaranth, mimosa, cork oak or dwarfed pine.  There were a
quick-lunch shack and two barnlike stages and everywhere about the
lot, groups of waiting, hopeful, painted faces.

After ten minutes a young man with hair the color of canary
feathers hurried down to the gate.

"Come in, Miss Hoyt.  Mr. Brady's on the set, but he's very anxious
to see you.  I'm sorry you were kept waiting, but you know some of
these French dames are worse about pushing themselves in--"

The studio manager opened a small door in the blank wall of stage
building and with sudden glad familiarity Rosemary followed him
into half darkness.  Here and there figures spotted the twilight,
turning up ashen faces to her like souls in purgatory watching the
passage of a mortal through.  There were whispers and soft voices
and, apparently from afar, the gentle tremolo of a small organ.
Turning the corner made by some flats, they came upon the white
crackling glow of a stage, where a French actor--his shirt front,
collar, and cuffs tinted a brilliant pink--and an American actress
stood motionless face to face.  They stared at each other with
dogged eyes, as though they had been in the same position for
hours; and still for a long time nothing happened, no one moved.  A
bank of lights went off with a savage hiss, went on again; the
plaintive tap of a hammer begged admission to nowhere in the
distance; a blue face appeared among the blinding lights above,
called something unintelligible into the upper blackness.  Then the
silence was broken by a voice in front of Rosemary.

"Baby, you don't take off the stockings, you can spoil ten more
pairs.  That dress is fifteen pounds."

Stepping backward the speaker ran against Rosemary, whereupon the
studio manager said, "Hey, Earl--Miss Hoyt."

They were meeting for the first time.  Brady was quick and
strenuous.  As he took her hand she saw him look her over from head
to foot, a gesture she recognized and that made her feel at home,
but gave her always a faint feeling of superiority to whoever made
it.  If her person was property she could exercise whatever
advantage was inherent in its ownership.

"I thought you'd be along any day now," Brady said, in a voice that
was just a little too compelling for private life, and that trailed
with it a faintly defiant cockney accent.  "Have a good trip?"

"Yes, but we're glad to be going home."

"No-o-o!" he protested.  "Stay awhile--I want to talk to you.  Let
me tell you that was some picture of yours--that 'Daddy's Girl.'  I
saw it in Paris.  I wired the coast right away to see if you were
signed."

"I just had--I'm sorry."

"God, what a picture!"

Not wanting to smile in silly agreement Rosemary frowned.

"Nobody wants to be thought of forever for just one picture," she
said.

"Sure--that's right.  What're your plans?"

"Mother thought I needed a rest.  When I get back we'll probably
either sign up with First National or keep on with Famous."

"Who's we?"

"My mother.  She decides business matters.  I couldn't do without
her."

Again he looked her over completely, and, as he did, something in
Rosemary went out to him.  It was not liking, not at all the
spontaneous admiration she had felt for the man on the beach this
morning.  It was a click.  He desired her and, so far as her
virginal emotions went, she contemplated a surrender with
equanimity.  Yet she knew she would forget him half an hour after
she left him--like an actor kissed in a picture.

"Where are you staying?" Brady asked.  "Oh, yes, at Gausse's.
Well, my plans are made for this year, too, but that letter I wrote
you still stands.  Rather make a picture with you than any girl
since Connie Talmadge was a kid."

"I feel the same way.  Why don't you come back to Hollywood?"

"I can't stand the damn place.  I'm fine here.  Wait till after
this shot and I'll show you around."

Walking onto the set he began to talk to the French actor in a low,
quiet voice.

Five minutes passed--Brady talked on, while from time to time the
Frenchman shifted his feet and nodded.  Abruptly, Brady broke off,
calling something to the lights that startled them into a humming
glare.  Los Angeles was loud about Rosemary now.  Unappalled she
moved once more through the city of thin partitions, wanting to be
back there.  But she did not want to see Brady in the mood she
sensed he would be in after he had finished and she left the lot
with a spell still upon her.  The Mediterranean world was less
silent now that she knew the studio was there.  She liked the
people on the streets and bought herself a pair of espadrilles on
the way to the train.



Her mother was pleased that she had done so accurately what she was
told to do, but she still wanted to launch her out and away.  Mrs.
Speers was fresh in appearance but she was tired; death beds make
people tired indeed and she had watched beside a couple.

Feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, Nicole Diver folded her
arms high enough for the artificial camellia on her shoulder to
touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely grassless garden.
The garden was bounded on one side by the house, from which it
flowed and into which it ran, on two sides by the old village, and
on the last by the cliff falling by ledges to the sea.

Along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the wriggling
vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual wheel-barrow,
left only a moment since, but already grown into the path,
atrophied and faintly rotten.  Nicole was invariably somewhat
surprised that by turning in the other direction past a bed of
peonies she walked into an area so green and cool that the leaves
and petals were curled with tender damp.

Knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in the
achromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and down around
her moving feet in a lilac shadow.  Her face was hard, almost
stern, save for the soft gleam of piteous doubt that looked from
her green eyes.  Her once fair hair had darkened, but she was
lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been at eighteen, when her
hair was brighter than she.

Following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom that
followed the white border stones she came to a space overlooking
the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the fig trees and a big
table and wicker chairs and a great market umbrella from Sienna,
all gathered about an enormous pine, the biggest tree in the
garden.  She paused there a moment, looking absently at a growth of
nasturtiums and iris tangled at its foot, as though sprung from a
careless handful of seeds, listening to the plaints and accusations
of some nursery squabble in the house.  When this died away on the
summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies massed in
pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile mauve-stemmed
roses, transparent like sugar flowers in a confectioner's window--
until, as if the scherzo of color could reach no further intensity,
it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and moist steps went down to a
level five feet below.

Here there was a well with the boarding around it dank and slippery
even on the brightest days.  She went up the stairs on the other
side and into the vegetable garden; she walked rather quickly; she
liked to be active, though at times she gave an impression of
repose that was at once static and evocative.  This was because she
knew few words and believed in none, and in the world she was
rather silent, contributing just her share of urbane humor with a
precision that approached meagreness.  But at the moment when
strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the presence of this
economy she would seize the topic and rush off with it, feverishly
surprised with herself--then bring it back and relinquish it
abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient retriever, having been
adequate and something more.

As she stood in the fuzzy green light of the vegetable garden, Dick
crossed the path ahead of her going to his work house.  Nicole
waited silently till he had passed; then she went on through lines
of prospective salads to a little menagerie where pigeons and
rabbits and a parrot made a medley of insolent noises at her.
Descending to another ledge she reached a low, curved wall and
looked down seven hundred feet to the Mediterranean Sea.

She stood in the ancient hill village of Tarmes.  The villa and its
grounds were made out of a row of peasant dwellings that abutted on
the cliff--five small houses had been combined to make the house
and four destroyed to make the garden.  The exterior walls were
untouched so that from the road far below it was indistinguishable
from the violet gray mass of the town.

For a moment Nicole stood looking down at the Mediterranean but
there was nothing to do with that, even with her tireless hands.
Presently Dick came out of his one-room house carrying a telescope
and looked east toward Cannes.  In a moment Nicole swam into his
field of vision, whereupon he disappeared into his house and came
out with a megaphone.  He had many light mechanical devices.

"Nicole," he shouted, "I forgot to tell you that as a final
apostolic gesture I invited Mrs. Abrams, the woman with the white
hair."

"I suspected it.  It's an outrage."

The ease with which her reply reached him seemed to belittle his
megaphone, so she raised her voice and called, "Can you hear me?"

"Yes."  He lowered the megaphone and then raised it stubbornly.
"I'm going to invite some more people too.  I'm going to invite the
two young men."

"All right," she agreed placidly.

"I want to give a really BAD party.  I mean it.  I want to give a
party where there's a brawl and seductions and people going home
with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de
toilette.  You wait and see."

He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most
characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept
everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of
melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed.
This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion
to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity
with people.  Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially
suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and
uncritical love.  The reaction came when he realized the waste and
extravagance involved.  He sometimes looked back with awe at the
carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a
massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.

But to be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a
remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations
about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies,
buried under the compromises of how many years.  He won everyone
quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved
so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its
effect.  Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the
relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world.  So long
as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his
preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-
inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little
communicable memory of what he had said or done.

At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his first guests,
his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather promisingly, in his
hand, like a toreador's cape.  It was characteristic that after
greeting Rosemary and her mother he waited for them to speak first,
as if to allow them the reassurance of their own voices in new
surroundings.

To resume Rosemary's point of view it should be said that, under
the spell of the climb to Tarmes and the fresher air, she and her
mother looked about appreciatively.  Just as the personal qualities
of extraordinary people can make themselves plain in an
unaccustomed change of expression, so the intensely calculated
perfection of Villa Diana transpired all at once through such
minute failures as the chance apparition of a maid in the
background or the perversity of a cork.  While the first guests
arrived bringing with them the excitement of the night, the
domestic activity of the day receded past them gently, symbolized
by the Diver children and their governess still at supper on the
terrace.

"What a beautiful garden!" Mrs. Speers exclaimed.

"Nicole's garden," said Dick.  "She won't let it alone--she nags it
all the time, worries about its diseases.  Any day now I expect to
have her come down with Powdery Mildew or Fly Speck, or Late
Blight."  He pointed his forefinger decisively at Rosemary, saying
with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal interest, "I'm going
to save your reason--I'm going to give you a hat to wear on the
beach."

He turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he poured a
cocktail.  Earl Brady arrived, discovering Rosemary with surprise.
His manner was softer than at the studio, as if his differentness
had been put on at the gate, and Rosemary, comparing him instantly
with Dick Diver, swung sharply toward the latter.  In comparison
Earl Brady seemed faintly gross, faintly ill-bred; once more,
though, she felt an electric response to his person.

He spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up from their
outdoor supper.

"Hello, Lanier, how about a song?  Will you and Topsy sing me a
song?"

"What shall we sing?" agreed the little boy, with the odd chanting
accent of American children brought up in France.

"That song about 'Mon Ami Pierrot.'"

Brother and sister stood side by side without self-consciousness
and their voices soared sweet and shrill upon the evening air.


     "Au clair de la lune
      Mon Ami Pierrot
      PrÃªte-moi ta plume
      Pour Ã©crire un mot
      Ma chandelle est morte
      Je n'ai plus de feu
      Ouvre-moi ta porte
      Pour l'amour de Dieu."


The singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow with the
late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success.  Rosemary was
thinking that the Villa Diana was the centre of the world.  On such
a stage some memorable thing was sure to happen.  She lighted up
higher as the gate tinkled open and the rest of the guests arrived
in a body--the McKiscos, Mrs. Abrams, Mr. Dumphry, and Mr. Campion
came up to the terrace.

Rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment--she looked quickly
at Dick, as though to ask an explanation of this incongruous
mingling.  But there was nothing unusual in his expression.  He
greeted his new guests with a proud bearing and an obvious
deference to their infinite and unknown possibilities.  She
believed in him so much that presently she accepted the rightness
of the McKiscos' presence as if she had expected to meet them all
along.

"I've met you in Paris," McKisco said to Abe North, who with his
wife had arrived on their heels, "in fact I've met you twice."

"Yes, I remember," Abe said.

"Then where was it?" demanded McKisco, not content to let well
enough alone.

"Why, I think--"  Abe got tired of the game, "I can't remember."

The interchange filled a pause and Rosemary's instinct was that
something tactful should be said by somebody, but Dick made no
attempt to break up the grouping formed by these late arrivals, not
even to disarm Mrs. McKisco of her air of supercilious amusement.
He did not solve this social problem because he knew it was not of
importance at the moment and would solve itself.  He was saving his
newness for a larger effort, waiting a more significant moment for
his guests to be conscious of a good time.

Rosemary stood beside Tommy Barban--he was in a particularly
scornful mood and there seemed to be some special stimulus working
upon him.  He was leaving in the morning.

"Going home?"

"Home?  I have no home.  I am going to a war."

"What war?"

"What war?  Any war.  I haven't seen a paper lately but I suppose
there's a war--there always is."

"Don't you care what you fight for?"

"Not at all--so long as I'm well treated.  When I'm in a rut I come
to see the Divers, because then I know that in a few weeks I'll
want to go to war."

Rosemary stiffened.

"You like the Divers," she reminded him.

"Of course--especially her--but they make me want to go to war."

She considered this, to no avail.  The Divers made her want to stay
near them forever.

"You're half American," she said, as if that should solve the
problem.

"Also I'm half French, and I was educated in England and since I
was eighteen I've worn the uniforms of eight countries.  But I hope
I did not give you the impression that I am not fond of the Divers--
I am, especially of Nicole."

"How could any one help it?" she said simply.

She felt far from him.  The undertone of his words repelled her and
she withdrew her adoration for the Divers from the profanity of his
bitterness.  She was glad he was not next to her at dinner and she
was still thinking of his words "especially her" as they moved
toward the table in the garden.

For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path.  Alongside
his hard, neat brightness everything faded into the surety that he
knew everything.  For a year, which was forever, she had had money
and a certain celebrity and contact with the celebrated, and these
latter had presented themselves merely as powerful enlargements of
the people with whom the doctor's widow and her daughter had
associated in a hÃ´tel-pension in Paris.  Rosemary was a romantic
and her career had not provided many satisfactory opportunities on
that score.  Her mother, with the idea of a career for Rosemary,
would not tolerate any such spurious substitutes as the excitations
available on all sides, and indeed Rosemary was already beyond
that--she was In the movies but not at all At them.  So when she
had seen approval of Dick Diver in her mother's face it meant that
he was "the real thing"; it meant permission to go as far as she
could.

"I was watching you," he said, and she knew he meant it.  "We've
grown very fond of you."

"I fell in love with you the first time I saw you," she said
quietly.  He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment were
purely formal.

"New friends," he said, as if it were an important point, "can
often have a better time together than old friends."

With that remark, which she did not understand precisely, she found
herself at the table, picked out by slowly emerging lights against
the dark dusk.  A chord of delight struck inside her when she saw
that Dick had taken her mother on his right hand; for herself she
was between Luis Campion and Brady.

Surcharged with her emotion she turned to Brady with the intention
of confiding in him, but at her first mention of Dick a hard-boiled
sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand that he refused the
fatherly office.  In turn she was equally firm when he tried to
monopolize her hand, so they talked shop or rather she listened
while he talked shop, her polite eyes never leaving his face, but
her mind was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he must guess
the fact.  Intermittently she caught the gist of his sentences and
supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one picks up the
striking of a clock in the middle with only the rhythm of the first
uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.


In a pause Rosemary looked away and up the table where Nicole sat
between Tommy Barban and Abe North, her chow's hair foaming and
frothing in the candlelight.  Rosemary listened, caught sharply by
the rich clipped voice in infrequent speech:

"The poor man," Nicole exclaimed.  "Why did you want to saw him in
two?"

"Naturally I wanted to see what was inside a waiter.  Wouldn't you
like to know what was inside a waiter?"

"Old menus," suggested Nicole with a short laugh.  "Pieces of
broken china and tips and pencil stubs."

"Exactly--but the thing was to prove it scientifically.  And of
course doing it with that musical saw would have eliminated any
sordidness."

"Did you intend to play the saw while you performed the operation?"
Tommy inquired.

"We didn't get quite that far.  We were alarmed by the screams.  We
thought he might rupture something."

"All sounds very peculiar to me," said Nicole.  "Any musician
that'll use another musician's saw to--"

They had been at table half an hour and a perceptible change had
set in--person by person had given up something, a preoccupation,
an anxiety, a suspicion, and now they were only their best selves
and the Divers' guests.  Not to have been friendly and interested
would have seemed to reflect on the Divers, so now they were all
trying, and seeing this, Rosemary liked everyone--except McKisco,
who had contrived to be the unassimilated member of the party.
This was less from ill will than from his determination to sustain
with wine the good spirits he had enjoyed on his arrival.  Lying
back in his place between Earl Brady, to whom he had addressed
several withering remarks about the movies, and Mrs. Abrams, to
whom he said nothing, he stared at Dick Diver with an expression of
devastating irony, the effect being occasionally interrupted by his
attempts to engage Dick in a cater-cornered conversation across the
table.

"Aren't you a friend of Van Buren Denby?" he would say.

"I don't believe I know him."

"I thought you were a friend of his," he persisted irritably.

When the subject of Mr. Denby fell of its own weight, he essayed
other equally irrelative themes, but each time the very deference
of Dick's attention seemed to paralyze him, and after a moment's
stark pause the conversation that he had interrupted would go on
without him.  He tried breaking into other dialogues, but it was
like continually shaking hands with a glove from which the hand had
been withdrawn--so finally, with a resigned air of being among
children, he devoted his attention entirely to the champagne.

Rosemary's glance moved at intervals around the table, eager for
the others' enjoyment, as if they were her future stepchildren.  A
gracious table light, emanating from a bowl of spicy pinks, fell
upon Mrs. Abrams' face, cooked to a turn in Veuve Cliquot, full of
vigor, tolerance, adolescent good will; next to her sat Mr. Royal
Dumphry, his girl's comeliness less startling in the pleasure world
of evening.  Then Violet McKisco, whose prettiness had been piped
to the surface of her, so that she ceased her struggle to make
tangible to herself her shadowy position as the wife of an
arriviste who had not arrived.

Then came Dick, with his arms full of the slack he had taken up
from others, deeply merged in his own party.

Then her mother, forever perfect.

Then Barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency that made
Rosemary like him again.  Then Nicole.  Rosemary saw her suddenly
in a new way and found her one of the most beautiful people she had
ever known.  Her face, the face of a saint, a viking Madonna, shone
through the faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew
down its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine.  She was
still as still.

Abe North was talking to her about his moral code:  "Of course I've
got one," he insisted, "--a man can't live without a moral code.
Mine is that I'm against the burning of witches.  Whenever they
burn a witch I get all hot under the collar."  Rosemary knew from
Brady that he was a musician who after a brilliant and precocious
start had composed nothing for seven years.

Next was Campion, managing somehow to restrain his most blatant
effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near him a certain
disinterested motherliness.  Then Mary North with a face so merry
that it was impossible not to smile back into the white mirrors of
her teeth--the whole area around her parted lips was a lovely
little circle of delight.

Finally Brady, whose heartiness became, moment by moment, a social
thing instead of a crude assertion and reassertion of his own
mental health, and his preservation of it by a detachment from the
frailties of others.

Rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of Mrs. Burnett's
vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of a return from
the derisive and salacious improvisations of the frontier.  There
were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dog baying on some low
and far-away ledge of the cliff.  The table seemed to have risen a
little toward the sky like a mechanical dancing platform, giving
the people around it a sense of being alone with each other in the
dark universe, nourished by its only food, warmed by its only
lights.  And, as if a curious hushed laugh from Mrs. McKisco were a
signal that such a detachment from the world had been attained, the
two Divers began suddenly to warm and glow and expand, as if to
make up to their guests, already so subtly assured of their
importance, so flattered with politeness, for anything they might
still miss from that country well left behind.  Just for a moment
they seemed to speak to every one at the table, singly and
together, assuring them of their friendliness, their affection.
And for a moment the faces turned up toward them were like the
faces of poor children at a Christmas tree.  Then abruptly the
table broke up--the moment when the guests had been daringly lifted
above conviviality into the rarer atmosphere of sentiment, was over
before it could be irreverently breathed, before they had half
realized it was there.

But the diffused magic of the hot sweet South had withdrawn into
them--the soft-pawed night and the ghostly wash of the Mediterranean
far below--the magic left these things and melted into the two
Divers and became part of them.  Rosemary watched Nicole pressing
upon her mother a yellow evening bag she had admired, saying, "I
think things ought to belong to the people that like them"--and
then sweeping into it all the yellow articles she could find, a
pencil, a lipstick, a little note book, "because they all go
together."

Nicole disappeared and presently Rosemary noticed that Dick was no
longer there; the guests distributed themselves in the garden or
drifted in toward the terrace.

"Do you want," Violet McKisco asked Rosemary, "to go to the
bathroom?"

Not at that precise moment.

"I want," insisted Mrs. McKisco, "to go to the bathroom."  As a
frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house, dragging her
secret after her, while Rosemary looked after with reprobation.
Earl Brady proposed that they walk down to the sea wall but she
felt that this was her time to have a share of Dick Diver when he
reappeared, so she stalled, listening to McKisco quarrel with
Barban.

"Why do you want to fight the Soviets?" McKisco said.  "The
greatest experiment ever made by humanity?  And the Riff?  It seems
to me it would be more heroic to fight on the just side."

"How do you find out which it is?" asked Barban dryly.

"Why--usually everybody intelligent knows."

"Are you a Communist?"

"I'm a Socialist," said McKisco, "I sympathize with Russia."

"Well, I'm a soldier," Barban answered pleasantly.  "My business is
to kill people.  I fought against the Riff because I am a European,
and I have fought the Communists because they want to take my
property from me."

"Of all the narrow-minded excuses," McKisco looked around to
establish a derisive liaison with some one else, but without
success.  He had no idea what he was up against in Barban, neither
of the simplicity of the other man's bag of ideas nor of the
complexity of his training.  McKisco knew what ideas were, and as
his mind grew he was able to recognize and sort an increasing
number of them--but faced by a man whom he considered "dumb," one
in whom he found no ideas he could recognize as such, and yet to
whom he could not feel personally superior, he jumped at the
conclusion that Barban was the end product of an archaic world, and
as such, worthless.  McKisco's contacts with the princely classes
in America had impressed upon him their uncertain and fumbling
snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their deliberate rudeness,
all lifted from the English with no regard paid to factors that
make English philistinism and rudeness purposeful, and applied in a
land where a little knowledge and civility buy more than they do
anywhere else--an attitude which reached its apogee in the "Harvard
manner" of about 1900.  He thought that this Barban was of that
type, and being drunk rashly forgot that he was in awe of him--this
led up to the trouble in which he presently found himself.

Feeling vaguely ashamed for McKisco, Rosemary waited, placid but
inwardly on fire, for Dick Diver's return.  From her chair at the
deserted table with Barban, McKisco, and Abe she looked up along
the path edged with shadowy myrtle and fern to the stone terrace,
and falling in love with her mother's profile against a lighted
door, was about to go there when Mrs. McKisco came hurrying down
from the house.

She exuded excitement.  In the very silence with which she pulled
out a chair and sat down, her eyes staring, her mouth working a
little, they all recognized a person crop-full of news, and her
husband's "What's the matter, Vi?" came naturally, as all eyes
turned toward her.

"My dear--" she said at large, and then addressed Rosemary, "my
dear--it's nothing.  I really can't say a word."

"You're among friends," said Abe.

"Well, upstairs I came upon a scene, my dears--"

Shaking her head cryptically she broke off just in time, for Tommy
arose and addressed her politely but sharply:

"It's inadvisable to comment on what goes on in this house."


Violet breathed loud and hard once and with an effort brought
another expression into her face.

Dick came finally and with a sure instinct he separated Barban and
the McKiscos and became excessively ignorant and inquisitive about
literature with McKisco--thus giving the latter the moment of
superiority which he required.  The others helped him carry lamps
up--who would not be pleased at carrying lamps helpfully through
the darkness?  Rosemary helped, meanwhile responding patiently to
Royal Dumphry's inexhaustible curiosity about Hollywood.

Now--she was thinking--I've earned a time alone with him.  He must
know that because his laws are like the laws Mother taught me.

Rosemary was right--presently he detached her from the company on
the terrace, and they were alone together, borne away from the
house toward the seaside wall with what were less steps than
irregularly spaced intervals through some of which she was pulled,
through others blown.

They looked out over the Mediterranean.  Far below, the last
excursion boat from the Isles des Lerins floated across the bay
like a Fourth-of-July balloon foot-loose in the heavens.  Between
the black isles it floated, softly parting the dark tide.

"I understand why you speak as you do of your mother," he said.
"Her attitude toward you is very fine, I think.  She has a sort of
wisdom that's rare in America."

"Mother is perfect," she prayed.

"I was talking to her about a plan I have--she told me that how
long you both stayed in France depended on you."

On YOU, Rosemary all but said aloud.

"So since things are over down here--"

"Over?" she inquired.

"Well, this is over--this part of the summer is over.  Last week
Nicole's sister left, to-morrow Tommy Barban leaves, Monday Abe and
Mary North are leaving.  Maybe we'll have more fun this summer but
this particular fun is over.  I want it to die violently instead of
fading out sentimentally--that's why I gave this party.  What I'm
coming to is--Nicole and I are going up to Paris to see Abe North
off for America--I wonder if you'd like to go with us."

"What did Mother say?"

"She seemed to think it would be fine.  She doesn't want to go
herself.  She wants you to go alone."

"I haven't seen Paris since I've been grown," said Rosemary.  "I'd
love to see it with you."

"That's nice of you."  Did she imagine that his voice was suddenly
metallic?  "Of course we've been excited about you from the moment
you came on the beach.  That vitality, we were sure it was
professional--especially Nicole was.  It'd never use itself up on
any one person or group."

Her instinct cried out to her that he was passing her along slowly
toward Nicole and she put her own brakes on, saying with an equal
harness:

"I wanted to know all of you too--especially you.  I told you I
fell in love with you the first time I saw you."

She was right going at it that way.  But the space between heaven
and earth had cooled his mind, destroyed the impulsiveness that had
led him to bring her here, and made him aware of the too obvious
appeal, the struggle with an unrehearsed scene and unfamiliar
words.

He tried now to make her want to go back to the house and it was
difficult, and he did not quite want to lose her.  She felt only
the draft blowing as he joked with her good-humoredly.

"You don't know what you want.  You go and ask your mother what you
want."

She was stricken.  She touched him, feeling the smooth cloth of his
dark coat like a chasuble.  She seemed about to fall to her knees--
from that position she delivered her last shot.

"I think you're the most wonderful person I ever met--except my
mother."

"You have romantic eyes."

His laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where he delivered
her to Nicole. . . .

Too soon it had become time to go and the Divers helped them all to
go quickly.  In the Divers' big Isotta there would be Tommy Barban
and his baggage--he was spending the night at the hotel to catch an
early train--with Mrs. Abrams, the McKiscos and Campion.  Earl
Brady was going to drop Rosemary and her mother on his way to Monte
Carlo, and Royal Dumphry rode with them because the Divers' car was
crowded.  Down in the garden lanterns still glowed over the table
where they had dined, as the Divers stood side by side in the gate,
Nicole blooming away and filling the night with graciousness, and
Dick bidding good-by to everyone by name.  To Rosemary it seemed
very poignant to drive away and leave them in their house.  Again
she wondered what Mrs. McKisco had seen in the bathroom.

It was a limpid black night, hung as in a basket from a single dull
star.  The horn of the car ahead was muffled by the resistance of
the thick air.  Brady's chauffeur drove slowly; the tail-light of
the other car appeared from time to time at turnings--then not at
all.  But after ten minutes it came into sight again, drawn up at
the side of the road.  Brady's chauffeur slowed up behind but
immediately it began to roll forward slowly and they passed it.  In
the instant they passed it they heard a blur of voices from behind
the reticence of the limousine and saw that the Divers' chauffeur
was grinning.  Then they went on, going fast through the
alternating banks of darkness and thin night, descending at last in
a series of roller-coaster swoops, to the great bulk of Gausse's
hotel.

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the
moonshine.  Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future
quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss,
but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures.  She
changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia
she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother's mind about
the question.  In this process she was often acute beyond her
experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had
gone into her half-heard.

Rosemary had been brought up with the idea of work.  Mrs. Speers
had spent the slim leavings of the men who had widowed her on her
daughter's education, and when she blossomed out at sixteen with
that extraordinary hair, rushed her to Aix-les-Bains and marched
her unannounced into the suite of an American producer who was
recuperating there.  When the producer went to New York they went
too.  Thus Rosemary had passed her entrance examinations.  With the
ensuing success and the promise of comparative stability that
followed, Mrs. Speers had felt free to tacitly imply tonight:

"You were brought up to work--not especially to marry.  Now you've
found your first nut to crack and it's a good nut--go ahead and put
whatever happens down to experience.  Wound yourself or him--
whatever happens it can't spoil you because economically you're a
boy, not a girl."

Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the
illimitability of her mother's perfections, so this final severance
of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep.  A false dawn sent the
sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she
walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet.  There were
secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured
triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court;
footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking
their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the
cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away.  Beyond
the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the
Divers.  She thought of them both together, heard them still
singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote
in time and far away.  Their children slept, their gate was shut
for the night.

She went inside and dressing in a light gown and espadrilles went
out her window again and along the continuous terrace toward the
front door, going fast since she found that other private rooms,
exuding sleep, gave upon it.  She stopped at the sight of a figure
seated on the wide white stairway of the formal entrance--then she
saw that it was Luis Campion and that he was weeping.

He was weeping hard and quietly and shaking in the same parts as a
weeping woman.  A scene in a role she had played last year swept
over her irresistibly and advancing she touched him on the
shoulder.  He gave a little yelp before he recognized her.

"What is it?"  Her eyes were level and kind and not slanted into
him with hard curiosity.  "Can I help you?"

"Nobody can help me.  I knew it.  I have only myself to blame.
It's always the same."

"What is it--do you want to tell me?"

He looked at her to see.

"No," he decided.  "When you're older you'll know what people who
love suffer.  The agony.  It's better to be cold and young than to
love.  It's happened to me before but never like this--so
accidental--just when everything was going well."

His face was repulsive in the quickening light.  Not by a flicker
of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle, did she
betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was.  But Campion's
sensitivity realized it and he changed the subject rather suddenly.

"Abe North is around here somewhere."

"Why, he's staying at the Divers'!"

"Yes, but he's up--don't you know what happened?"

A shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above and an
English voice spat distinctly:

"Will you kaindlay stup tucking!"

Rosemary and Luis Campion went humbly down the steps and to a bench
beside the road to the beach.

"Then you have no idea what's happened?  My dear, the most
extraordinary thing--"  He was warming up now, hanging on to his
revelation.  "I've never seen a thing come so suddenly--I have
always avoided violent people--they upset me so I sometimes have to
go to bed for days."

He looked at her triumphantly.  She had no idea what he was talking
about.

"My dear," he burst forth, leaning toward her with his whole body
as he touched her on the upper leg, to show it was no mere
irresponsible venture of his hand--he was so sure of himself.
"There's going to be a duel."

"Wh-at?"

"A duel with--we don't know what yet."

"Who's going to duel?"

"I'll tell you from the beginning."  He drew a long breath and then
said, as if it were rather to her discredit but he wouldn't hold it
against her.  "Of course, you were in the other automobile.  Well,
in a way you were lucky--I lost at least two years of my life, it
came so suddenly."

"What came?" she demanded.

"I don't know what began it.  First she began to talk--"

"Who?"

"Violet McKisco."  He lowered his voice as if there were people
under the bench.  "But don't mention the Divers because he made
threats against anybody who mentioned it."

"Who did?"

"Tommy Barban, so don't you say I so much as mentioned them.  None
of us ever found out anyhow what it was Violet had to say because
he kept interrupting her, and then her husband got into it and now,
my dear, we have the duel.  This morning--at five o'clock--in an
hour."  He sighed suddenly thinking of his own griefs.  "I almost
wish it were I.  I might as well be killed now I have nothing to
live for."  He broke off and rocked to and fro with sorrow.

Again the iron shutter parted above and the same British voice
said:

"Rilly, this must stup immejetely."

Simultaneously Abe North, looking somewhat distracted, came out of
the hotel, perceived them against the sky, white over the sea.
Rosemary shook her head warningly before he could speak and they
moved another bench further down the road.  Rosemary saw that Abe
was a little tight.

"What are YOU doing up?" he demanded.

"I just got up."  She started to laugh, but remembering the voice
above, she restrained herself.

"Plagued by the nightingale," Abe suggested, and repeated,
"probably plagued by the nightingale.  Has this sewing-circle
member told you what happened?"

Campion said with dignity:

"I only know what I heard with my own ears."

He got up and walked swiftly away; Abe sat down beside Rosemary.

"Why did you treat him so badly?"

"Did I?" he asked surprised.  "He's been weeping around here all
morning."

"Well, maybe he's sad about something."

"Maybe he is."

"What about a duel?  Who's going to duel?  I thought there was
something strange in that car.  Is it true?"

"It certainly is coo-coo but it seems to be true."

The trouble began at the time Earl Brady's car passed the Divers'
car stopped on the road--Abe's account melted impersonally into the
thronged night--Violet McKisco was telling Mrs. Abrams something
she had found out about the Divers--she had gone upstairs in their
house and she had come upon something there which had made a great
impression on her.  But Tommy is a watch-dog about the Divers.  As
a matter of fact she is inspiring and formidable--but it's a mutual
thing, and the fact of The Divers together is more important to
their friends than many of them realize.  Of course it's done at a
certain sacrifice--sometimes they seem just rather charming figures
in a ballet, and worth just the attention you give a ballet, but
it's more than that--you'd have to know the story.  Anyhow Tommy is
one of those men that Dick's passed along to Nicole and when Mrs.
McKisco kept hinting at her story, he called them on it.  He said:

"Mrs. McKisco, please don't talk further about Mrs. Diver."

"I wasn't talking to you," she objected.

"I think it's better to leave them out."

"Are they so sacred?"

"Leave them out.  Talk about something else."

He was sitting on one of the two little seats beside Campion.
Campion told me the story.

"Well, you're pretty high-handed," Violet came back.

You know how conversations are in cars late at night, some people
murmuring and some not caring, giving up after the party, or bored
or asleep.  Well, none of them knew just what happened until the
car stopped and Barban cried in a voice that shook everybody, a
voice for cavalry.

"Do you want to step out here--we're only a mile from the hotel and
you can walk it or I'll drag you there.  YOU'VE GOT TO SHUT UP AND
SHUT YOUR WIFE UP!"

"You're a bully," said McKisco.  "You know you're stronger
muscularly than I am.  But I'm not afraid of you--what they ought
to have is the code duello--"

There's where he made his mistake because Tommy, being French,
leaned over and clapped him one, and then the chauffeur drove on.
That was where you passed them.  Then the women began.  That was
still the state of things when the car got to the hotel.

Tommy telephoned some man in Cannes to act as second and McKisco
said he wasn't going to be seconded by Campion, who wasn't crazy
for the job anyhow, so he telephoned me not to say anything but to
come right down.  Violet McKisco collapsed and Mrs. Abrams took her
to her room and gave her a bromide whereupon she fell comfortably
asleep on the bed.  When I got there I tried to argue with Tommy
but the latter wouldn't accept anything short of an apology and
McKisco rather spunkily wouldn't give it.



When Abe had finished Rosemary asked thoughtfully:

"Do the Divers know it was about them?"

"No--and they're not ever going to know they had anything to do
with it.  That damn Campion had no business talking to you about
it, but since he did--I told the chauffeur I'd get out the old
musical saw if he opened his mouth about it.  This fight's between
two men--what Tommy needs is a good war."

"I hope the Divers don't find out," Rosemary said.

Abe peered at his watch.

"I've got to go up and see McKisco--do you want to come?--he feels
sort of friendless--I bet he hasn't slept."

Rosemary had a vision of the desperate vigil that high-strung,
badly organized man had probably kept.  After a moment balanced
between pity and repugnance she agreed, and full of morning energy,
bounced upstairs beside Abe.

McKisco was sitting on his bed with his alcoholic combativeness
vanished, in spite of the glass of champagne in his hand.  He
seemed very puny and cross and white.  Evidently he had been
writing and drinking all night.  He stared confusedly at Abe and
Rosemary and asked:

"Is it time?"

"No, not for half an hour."

The table was covered with papers which he assembled with some
difficulty into a long letter; the writing on the last pages was
very large and illegible.  In the delicate light of electric lamps
fading, he scrawled his name at the bottom, crammed it into an
envelope and handed it to Abe.  "For my wife."

"You better souse your head in cold water," Abe suggested.

"You think I'd better?" inquired McKisco doubtfully.  "I don't want
to get too sober."

"Well, you look terrible now."

Obediently McKisco went into the bathroom.

"I'm leaving everything in an awful mess," he called.  "I don't
know how Violet will get back to America.  I don't carry any
insurance.  I never got around to it."

"Don't talk nonsense, you'll be right here eating breakfast in an
hour."

"Sure, I know."  He came back with his hair wet and looked at
Rosemary as if he saw her for the first time.  Suddenly tears stood
in his eyes.  "I never have finished my novel.  That's what makes
me so sore.  You don't like me," he said to Rosemary, "but that
can't be helped.  I'm primarily a literary man."  He made a vague
discouraged sound and shook his head helplessly.  "I've made lots
of mistakes in my life--many of them.  But I've been one of the
most prominent--in some ways--"

He gave this up and puffed at a dead cigarette.

"I do like you," said Rosemary, "but I don't think you ought to
fight a duel."

"Yeah, I should have tried to beat him up, but it's done now.  I've
let myself be drawn into something that I had no right to be.  I
have a very violent temper--"  He looked closely at Abe as if he
expected the statement to be challenged.  Then with an aghast laugh
he raised the cold cigarette butt toward his mouth.  His breathing
quickened.

"The trouble was I suggested the duel--if Violet had only kept her
mouth shut I could have fixed it.  Of course even now I can just
leave, or sit back and laugh at the whole thing--but I don't think
Violet would ever respect me again."

"Yes, she would," said Rosemary.  "She'd respect you more."

"No--you don't know Violet.  She's very hard when she gets an
advantage over you.  We've been married twelve years, we had a
little girl seven years old and she died and after that you know
how it is.  We both played around on the side a little, nothing
serious but drifting apart--she called me a coward out there
tonight."

Troubled, Rosemary didn't answer.

"Well, we'll see there's as little damage done as possible," said
Abe.  He opened the leather case.  "These are Barban's duelling
pistols--I borrowed them so you could get familiar with them.  He
carries them in his suitcase."  He weighed one of the archaic
weapons in his hand.  Rosemary gave an exclamation of uneasiness
and McKisco looked at the pistols anxiously.

"Well--it isn't as if we were going to stand up and pot each other
with forty-fives," he said.

"I don't know," said Abe cruelly; "the idea is you can sight better
along a long barrel."

"How about distance?" asked McKisco.

"I've inquired about that.  If one or the other parties has to be
definitely eliminated they make it eight paces, if they're just
good and sore it's twenty paces, and if it's only to vindicate
their honor it's forty paces.  His second agreed with me to make it
forty."

"That's good."

"There's a wonderful duel in a novel of Pushkin's," recollected
Abe.  "Each man stood on the edge of a precipice, so if he was hit
at all he was done for."

This seemed very remote and academic to McKisco, who stared at him
and said, "What?"

"Do you want to take a quick dip and freshen up?"

"No--no, I couldn t swim."  He sighed.  "I don't see what it's all
about," he said helplessly.  "I don't see why I'm doing it."

It was the first thing he had ever done in his life.  Actually he
was one of those for whom the sensual world does not exist, and
faced with a concrete fact he brought to it a vast surprise.

"We might as well be going," said Abe, seeing him fail a little.

"All right."  He drank off a stiff drink of brandy, put the flask
in his pocket, and said with almost a savage air:  "What'll happen
if I kill him--will they throw me in jail?"

"I'll run you over the Italian border."

He glanced at Rosemary--and then said apologetically to Abe:

"Before we start there's one thing I'd like to see you about
alone."

"I hope neither of you gets hurt," Rosemary said.  "I think it's
very foolish and you ought to try to stop it."

She found Campion downstairs in the deserted lobby.

"I saw you go upstairs," he said excitedly.  "Is he all right?
When is the duel going to be?"

"I don't know."  She resented his speaking of it as a circus, with
McKisco as the tragic clown.

"Will you go with me?" he demanded, with the air of having seats.
"I've hired the hotel car."

"I don't want to go."

"Why not?  I imagine it'll take years off my life but I wouldn't
miss it for worlds.  We could watch it from quite far away."

"Why don't you get Mr. Dumphry to go with you?"

His monocle fell out, with no whiskers to hide in--he drew himself
up.

"I never want to see him again."

"Well, I'm afraid I can't go.  Mother wouldn't like it."

As Rosemary entered her room Mrs. Speers stirred sleepily and
called to her:

"Where've you been?"

"I just couldn't sleep.  You go back to sleep, Mother."

"Come in my room."  Hearing her sit up in bed, Rosemary went in and
told her what had happened.

"Why don't you go and see it?" Mrs. Speers suggested.  "You needn't
go up close and you might be able to help afterwards."

Rosemary did not like the picture of herself looking on and she
demurred, but Mrs. Speer's consciousness was still clogged with
sleep and she was reminded of night calls to death and calamity
when she was the wife of a doctor.  "I like you to go places and do
things on your own initiative without me--you did much harder
things for Rainy's publicity stunts."

Still Rosemary did not see why she should go, but she obeyed the
sure, clear voice that had sent her into the stage entrance of the
Odeon in Paris when she was twelve and greeted her when she came
out again.

She thought she was reprieved when from the steps she saw Abe and
McKisco drive away--but after a moment the hotel car came around
the corner.  Squealing delightedly Luis Campion pulled her in
beside him.

"I hid there because they might not let us come.  I've got my movie
camera, you see."

She laughed helplessly.  He was so terrible that he was no longer
terrible, only dehumanized.

"I wonder why Mrs. McKisco didn't like the Divers?" she said.
"They were very nice to her."

"Oh, it wasn't that.  It was something she saw.  We never did find
exactly what it was because of Barban."

"Then that wasn't what made you so sad."

"Oh, no," he said, his voice breaking, "that was something else
that happened when we got back to the hotel.  But now I don't care--
I wash my hands of it completely."

They followed the other car east along the shore past Juan les
Pins, where the skeleton of the new Casino was rising.  It was past
four and under a blue-gray sky the first fishing boats were
creaking out into a glaucous sea.  Then they turned off the main
road and into the back country.

"It's the golf course," cried Campion, "I'm sure that's where it's
going to be."

He was right.  When Abe's car pulled up ahead of them the east was
crayoned red and yellow, promising a sultry day.  Ordering the
hotel car into a grove of pines Rosemary and Campion kept in the
shadow of a wood and skirted the bleached fairway where Abe and
McKisco were walking up and down, the latter raising his head at
intervals like a rabbit scenting.  Presently there were moving
figures over by a farther tee and the watchers made out Barban and
his French second--the latter carried the box of pistols under his
arm.

Somewhat appalled, McKisco slipped behind Abe and took a long
swallow of brandy.  He walked on choking and would have marched
directly up into the other party, but Abe stopped him and went
forward to talk to the Frenchman.  The sun was over the horizon.

Campion grabbed Rosemary's arm.

"I can't stand it," he squeaked, almost voiceless.  "It's too much.
This will cost me--"

"Let go," Rosemary said peremptorily.  She breathed a frantic
prayer in French.

The principals faced each other, Barban with the sleeve rolled up
from his arm.  His eyes gleamed restlessly in the sun, but his
motion was deliberate as he wiped his palm on the seam of his
trousers.  McKisco, reckless with brandy, pursed his lips in a
whistle and pointed his long nose about nonchalantly, until Abe
stepped forward with a handkerchief in his hand.  The French second
stood with his face turned away.  Rosemary caught her breath in
terrible pity and gritted her teeth with hatred for Barban; then:

"One--two--three!" Abe counted in a strained voice.

They fired at the same moment.  McKisco swayed but recovered
himself.  Both shots had missed.

"Now, that's enough!" cried Abe.

The duellists walked in, and everyone looked at Barban inquiringly.

"I declare myself unsatisfied."

"What?  Sure you're satisfied," said Abe impatiently.  "You just
don't know it."

"Your man refuses another shot?"

"You're damn right, Tommy.  You insisted on this and my client went
through with it."

Tommy laughed scornfully.

"The distance was ridiculous," he said.  "I'm not accustomed to
such farces--your man must remember he's not now in America."

"No use cracking at America," said Abe rather sharply.  And then,
in a more conciliatory tone, "This has gone far enough, Tommy."
They parleyed briskly for a moment--then Barban nodded and bowed
coldly to his late antagonist.

"No shake hand?" suggested the French doctor.

"They already know each other," said Abe.

He turned to McKisco.

"Come on, let's get out."

As they strode off, McKisco, in exultation, gripped his arm.

"Wait a minute!" Abe said.  "Tommy wants his pistol back.  He might
need it again."

McKisco handed it over.

"To hell with him," he said in a tough voice.  "Tell him he can--"

"Shall I tell him you want another shot?"

"Well, I did it," cried McKisco, as they went along.  "And I did it
pretty well, didn't I?  I wasn't yellow."

"You were pretty drunk," said Abe bluntly.

"No, I wasn't."

"All right, then, you weren't."

"Why would it make any difference if I had a drink or so?"

As his confidence mounted he looked resentfully at Abe.

"What difference does that make?" he repeated.

"If you can't see it, there's no use going into it."

"Don't you know everybody was drunk all the time during the war?"

"Well, let's forget it."

But the episode was not quite over.  There were urgent footsteps in
the heather behind them and the doctor drew up alongside.

"Pardon, Messieurs," he panted.  "Voulez-vous regler mes
honorairies? Naturellement c'est pour soins mÃ©dicaux seulement.  M.
Barban n'a qu'un billet de mille et ne peut pas les rÃ©gler et
l'autre a laissÃ© son porte-monnaie chez lui."

"Trust a Frenchman to think of that," said Abe, and then to the
doctor.  "Combien?"

"Let me pay this," said McKisco.

"No, I've got it.  We were all in about the same danger."

Abe paid the doctor while McKisco suddenly turned into the bushes
and was sick there.  Then paler than before he strutted on with Abe
toward the car through the now rosy morning.

Campion lay gasping on his back in the shrubbery, the only casualty
of the duel, while Rosemary suddenly hysterical with laughter kept
kicking at him with her espadrille.  She did this persistently
until she roused him--the only matter of importance to her now was
that in a few hours she would see the person whom she still
referred to in her mind as "the Divers" on the beach.

They were at Voisins waiting for Nicole, six of them, Rosemary, the
Norths, Dick Diver and two young French musicians.  They were
looking over the other patrons of the restaurant to see if they had
repose--Dick said no American men had any repose, except himself,
and they were seeking an example to confront him with.  Things
looked black for them--not a man had come into the restaurant for
ten minutes without raising his hand to his face.

"We ought never to have given up waxed mustaches," said Abe.
"Nevertheless Dick isn't the ONLY man with repose--"

"Oh, yes, I am."

"--but he may be the only sober man with repose."

A well-dressed American had come in with two women who swooped and
fluttered unselfconsciously around a table.  Suddenly, he perceived
that he was being watched--whereupon his hand rose spasmodically
and arranged a phantom bulge in his necktie.  In another unseated
party a man endlessly patted his shaven cheek with his palm, and
his companion mechanically raised and lowered the stub of a cold
cigar.  The luckier ones fingered eyeglasses and facial hair, the
unequipped stroked blank mouths, or even pulled desperately at the
lobes of their ears.

A well-known general came in, and Abe, counting on the man's first
year at West Point--that year during which no cadet can resign and
from which none ever recovers--made a bet with Dick of five
dollars.

His hands hanging naturally at his sides, the general waited to be
seated.  Once his arms swung suddenly backward like a jumper's and
Dick said, "Ah!" supposing he had lost control, but the general
recovered and they breathed again--the agony was nearly over, the
garÃ§on was pulling out his chair . . .

With a touch of fury the conqueror shot up his hand and scratched
his gray immaculate head.

"You see," said Dick smugly, "I'm the only one."

Rosemary was quite sure of it and Dick, realizing that he never had
a better audience, made the group into so bright a unit that
Rosemary felt an impatient disregard for all who were not at their
table.  They had been two days in Paris but actually they were
still under the beach umbrella.  When, as at the ball of the Corps
des Pages the night before, the surroundings seemed formidable to
Rosemary, who had yet to attend a Mayfair party in Hollywood, Dick
would bring the scene within range by greeting a few people, a sort
of selection--the Divers seemed to have a large acquaintance, but
it was always as if the person had not seen them for a long, long
time, and was utterly bowled over, "Why, where do you KEEP
yourselves?"--and then re-create the unity of his own party by
destroying the outsiders softly but permanently with an ironic coup
de grÃ¢ce.  Presently Rosemary seemed to have known those people
herself in some deplorable past, and then got on to them, rejected
them, discarded them.

Their own party was overwhelmingly American and sometimes scarcely
American at all.  It was themselves he gave back to them, blurred
by the compromises of how many years.

Into the dark, smoky restaurant, smelling of the rich raw foods on
the buffet, slid Nicole's sky-blue suit like a stray segment of the
weather outside.  Seeing from their eyes how beautiful she was, she
thanked them with a smile of radiant appreciation.  They were all
very nice people for a while, very courteous and all that.  Then
they grew tired of it and they were funny and bitter, and finally
they made a lot of plans.  They laughed at things that they would
not remember clearly afterward--laughed a lot and the men drank
three bottles of wine.  The trio of women at the table were
representative of the enormous flux of American life.  Nicole was
the granddaughter of a self-made American capitalist and the
granddaughter of a Count of the House of Lippe Weissenfeld.  Mary
North was the daughter of a journeyman paper-hanger and a
descendant of President Tyler.  Rosemary was from the middle of the
middle class, catapulted by her mother onto the uncharted heights
of Hollywood.  Their point of resemblance to each other and their
difference from so many American women, lay in the fact that they
were all happy to exist in a man's world--they preserved their
individuality through men and not by opposition to them.  They
would all three have made alternatively good courtesans or good
wives not by the accident of birth but through the greater accident
of finding their man or not finding him.

So Rosemary found it a pleasant party, that luncheon, nicer in that
there were only seven people, about the limit of a good party.
Perhaps, too, the fact that she was new to their world acted as a
sort of catalytic agent to precipitate out all their old
reservations about one another.  After the table broke up, a waiter
directed Rosemary back into the dark hinterland of all French
restaurants, where she looked up a phone number by a dim orange
bulb, and called Franco-American Films.  Sure, they had a print of
"Daddy's Girl"--it was out for the moment, but they would run it
off later in the week for her at 341 Rue des Saintes Anges--ask for
Mr. Crowder.

The semi-booth gave on the vestiaire and as Rosemary hung up the
receiver she heard two low voices not five feet from her on the
other side of a row of coats.

"--So you love me?"

"Oh, DO I!"

It Was Nicole--Rosemary hesitated in the door of the booth--then
she heard Dick say:

"I want you terribly--let's go to the hotel now."  Nicole gave a
little gasping sigh.  For a moment the words conveyed nothing at
all to Rosemary--but the tone did.  The vast secretiveness of it
vibrated to herself.

"I want you."

"I'll be at the hotel at four."

Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away.  She was at
first even astonished--she had seen them in their relation to each
other as people without personal exigencies--as something cooler.
Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her, profound and
unidentified.  She did not know whether she was attracted or
repelled, but only that she was deeply moved.  It made her feel
very alone as she went back into the restaurant, but it was
touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude of Nicole's
"Oh, DO I!" echoed in her mind.  The particular mood of the passage
she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was from it
her stomach told her it was all right--she had none of the aversion
she had felt in the playing of certain love scenes in pictures.

Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated in
it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much more conscious of the
assignation than Nicole herself.  She looked at Nicole in a new
way, estimating her attractions.  Certainly she was the most
attractive woman Rosemary had ever met--with her hardness, her
devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness, which Rosemary,
thinking now through her mother's middle-class mind, associated
with her attitude about money.  Rosemary spent money she had
earned--she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in
the pool six times that January day with her temperature roving
from 99Â° in the early morning to 103Â°, when her mother stopped it.

With Nicole's help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and
four pairs of shoes with her money.  Nicole bought from a great
list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the windows
besides.  Everything she liked that she couldn't possibly use
herself, she bought as a present for a friend.  She bought colored
beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey, a guest
bed, bags, scarfs, love birds, miniatures for a doll's house and
three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns.  She bought a
dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of
gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two chamois
leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from Hermes--
bought all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan
buying underwear and jewels, which were after all professional
equipment and insurance--but with an entirely different point of
view.  Nicole was the product of much ingenuity and toil.  For her
sake trains began their run at Chicago and traversed the round
belly of the continent to California; chicle factories fumed and
link belts grew link by link in factories; men mixed toothpaste in
vats and drew mouthwash out of copper hogsheads; girls canned
tomatoes quickly in August or worked rudely at the Five-and-Tens on
Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians toiled on Brazilian coffee
plantations and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new
tractors--these were some of the people who gave a tithe to Nicole,
and as the whole system swayed and thundered onward it lent a
feverish bloom to such processes of hers as wholesale buying, like
the flush of a fireman's face holding his post before a spreading
blaze.  She illustrated very simple principles, containing in
herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there
was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to
imitate it.

It was almost four.  Nicole stood in a shop with a love bird on her
shoulder, and had one of her infrequent outbursts of speech.

"Well, what if you hadn't gone in that pool that day--I sometimes
wonder about such things.  Just before the war we were in Berlin--I
was thirteen, it was just before Mother died.  My sister was going
to a court ball and she had three of the royal princes on her dance
card, all arranged by a chamberlain and everything.  Half an hour
before she was going to start she had a side ache and a high fever.
The doctor said it was appendicitis and she ought to be operated
on.  But Mother had her plans made, so Baby went to the ball and
danced till two with an ice pack strapped on under her evening
dress.  She was operated on at seven o'clock next morning."

It was good to be hard, then; all nice people were hard on
themselves.  But it was four o'clock and Rosemary kept thinking of
Dick waiting for Nicole now at the hotel.  She must go there, she
must not make him wait for her.  She kept thinking, "Why don't you
go?" and then suddenly, "Or let me go if you don't want to."  But
Nicole went to one more place to buy corsages for them both and
sent one to Mary North.  Only then she seemed to remember and with
sudden abstraction she signalled for a taxi.

"Good-by," said Nicole.  "We had fun, didn't we?"

"Loads of fun," said Rosemary.  It was more difficult than she
thought and her whole self protested as Nicole drove away.

Dick turned the corner of the traverse and continued along the
trench walking on the duckboard.  He came to a periscope, looked
through it a moment; then he got up on the step and peered over the
parapet.  In front of him beneath a dingy sky was Beaumont Hamel;
to his left the tragic hill of Thiepval.  Dick stared at them
through his field glasses, his throat straining with sadness.

He went on along the trench, and found the others waiting for him
in the next traverse.  He was full of excitement and he wanted to
communicate it to them, to make them understand about this, though
actually Abe North had seen battle service and he had not.

"This land here cost twenty lives a foot that summer," he said to
Rosemary.  She looked out obediently at the rather bare green plain
with its low trees of six years' growth.  If Dick had added that
they were now being shelled she would have believed him that
afternoon.  Her love had reached a point where now at last she was
beginning to be unhappy, to be desperate.  She didn't know what to
do--she wanted to talk to her mother.

"There are lots of people dead since and we'll all be dead soon,"
said Abe consolingly.

Rosemary waited tensely for Dick to continue.

"See that little stream--we could walk to it in two minutes.  It
took the British a month to walk to it--a whole empire walking very
slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind.  And another
empire walked very slowly backward a few inches a day, leaving the
dead like a million bloody rugs.  No Europeans will ever do that
again in this generation."

"Why, they've only just quit over in Turkey," said Abe.  "And in
Morocco--"

"That's different.  This western-front business couldn't be done
again, not for a long time.  The young men think they could do it
but they couldn't.  They could fight the first Marne again but not
this.  This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous
sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes.
The Russians and Italians weren't any good on this front.  You had
to have a whole-souled sentimental equipment going back further
than you could remember.  You had to remember Christmas, and
postcards of the Crown Prince and his fiancÃ©e, and little cafÃ©s in
Valence and beer gardens in Unter den Linden and weddings at the
mairie, and going to the Derby, and your grandfather's whiskers."

"General Grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg in sixty-
five."

"No, he didn't--he just invented mass butchery.  This kind of
battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever
wrote Undine, and country deacons bowling and marraines in
Marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes of Wurtemburg and
Westphalia.  Why, this was a love battle--there was a century of
middle-class love spent here.  This was the last love battle."

"You want to hand over this battle to D. H. Lawrence," said Abe.

"All my beautiful lovely safe world blew itself up here with a
great gust of high explosive love," Dick mourned persistently.
"Isn't that true, Rosemary?"

"I don't know," she answered with a grave face.  "You know
everything."

They dropped behind the others.  Suddenly a shower of earth gobs
and pebbles came down on them and Abe yelled from the next
traverse:

"The war spirit's getting into me again.  I have a hundred years of
Ohio love behind me and I'm going to bomb out this trench."  His
head popped up over the embankment.  "You're dead--don't you know
the rules?  That was a grenade."

Rosemary laughed and Dick picked up a retaliatory handful of stones
and then put them down.

"I couldn't kid here," he said rather apologetically.  "The silver
cord is cut and the golden bowl is broken and all that, but an old
romantic like me can't do anything about it."

"I'm romantic too."

They came out of the neat restored trench, and faced a memorial to
the Newfoundland dead.  Reading the inscription Rosemary burst into
sudden tears.  Like most women she liked to be told how she should
feel, and she liked Dick's telling her which things were ludicrous
and which things were sad.  But most of all she wanted him to know
how she loved him, now that the fact was upsetting everything, now
that she was walking over the battlefield in a thrilling dream.

After that they got in their car and started back toward Amiens.  A
thin warm rain was falling on the new scrubby woods and underbrush
and they passed great funeral pyres of sorted duds, shells, bombs,
grenades, and equipment, helmets, bayonets, gun stocks and rotten
leather, abandoned six years in the ground.  And suddenly around a
bend the white caps of a great sea of graves.  Dick asked the
chauffeur to stop.

"There's that girl--and she still has her wreath."

They watched as he got out and went over to the girl, who stood
uncertainly by the gate with a wreath in her hand.  Her taxi
waited.  She was a red-haired girl from Tennessee whom they had met
on the train this morning, come from Knoxville to lay a memorial on
her brother's grave.  There were tears of vexation on her face.

"The War Department must have given me the wrong number," she
whimpered.  "It had another name on it.  I been lookin' for it
since two o'clock, and there's so many graves."

"Then if I were you I'd just lay it on any grave without looking at
the name," Dick advised her.

"You reckon that's what I ought to do?"

"I think that's what he'd have wanted you to do."

It was growing dark and the rain was coming down harder.

She left the wreath on the first grave inside the gate, and
accepted Dick's suggestion that she dismiss her taxi-cab and ride
back to Amiens with them.

Rosemary shed tears again when she heard of the mishap--altogether
it had been a watery day, but she felt that she had learned
something, though exactly what it was she did not know.  Later she
remembered all the hours of the afternoon as happy--one of those
uneventful times that seem at the moment only a link between past
and future pleasure but turn out to have been the pleasure itself.

Amiens was an echoing purple town, still sad with the war, as some
railroad stations were:--the Gare du Nord and Waterloo station in
London.  In the daytime one is deflated by such towns, with their
little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great gray
cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very
weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like
that of old photographs.  But after dark all that is most
satisfactory in French life swims back into the picture--the
sprightly tarts, the men arguing with a hundred VoilÃ s in the
cafÃ©s, the couples drifting, head to head, toward the satisfactory
inexpensiveness of nowhere.  Waiting for the train they sat in a
big arcade, tall enough to release the smoke and chatter and music
upward and obligingly the orchestra launched into "Yes, We Have No
Bananas,"--they clapped, because the leader looked so pleased with
himself.  The Tennessee girl forgot her sorrow and enjoyed herself,
even began flirtations of tropical eye-rollings and pawings, with
Dick and Abe.  They teased her gently.

Then, leaving infinitesimal sections of Wurtemburgers, Prussian
Guards, Chasseurs Alpins, Manchester mill hands and old Etonians to
pursue their eternal dissolution under the warm rain, they took the
train for Paris.  They ate sandwiches of mortadel sausage and bel
paese cheese made up in the station restaurant, and drank
Beaujolais.  Nicole was abstracted, biting her lip restlessly and
reading over the guide-books to the battle-field that Dick had
brought along--indeed, he had made a quick study of the whole
affair, simplifying it always until it bore a faint resemblance to
one of his own parties.


When they reached Paris Nicole was too tired to go on to the grand
illumination at the Decorative Art Exposition as they had planned.
They left her at the Hotel Roi George, and as she disappeared
between the intersecting planes made by lobby lights of the glass
doors, Rosemary's oppression lifted.  Nicole was a force--not
necessarily well disposed or predictable like her mother--an
incalculable force.  Rosemary was somewhat afraid of her.

At eleven she sat with Dick and the Norths at a houseboat cafÃ© just
opened on the Seine.  The river shimmered with lights from the
bridges and cradled many cold moons.  On Sundays sometimes when
Rosemary and her mother had lived in Paris they had taken the
little steamer up to Suresnes and talked about plans for the
future.  They had little money but Mrs. Speers was so sure of
Rosemary's beauty and had implanted in her so much ambition, that
she was willing to gamble the money on "advantages"; Rosemary in
turn was to repay her mother when she got her start. . . .

Since reaching Paris Abe North had had a thin vinous fur over him;
his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine.  Rosemary realized for
the first time that he was always stopping in places to get a
drink, and she wondered how Mary North liked it.  Mary was quiet,
so quiet save for her frequent laughter that Rosemary had learned
little about her.  She liked the straight dark hair brushed back
until it met some sort of natural cascade that took care of it--
from time to time it eased with a jaunty slant over the corner of
her temple, until it was almost in her eye when she tossed her head
and caused it to fall sleek into place once more.

"We'll turn in early to-night, Abe, after this drink."  Mary's
voice was light but it held a little flicker of anxiety.  "You
don't want to be poured on the boat."

"It's pretty late now," Dick said.  "We'd all better go."

The noble dignity of Abe's face took on a certain stubbornness, and
he remarked with determination:

"Oh, no."  He paused gravely.  "Oh, no, not yet.  We'll have
another bottle of champagne."

"No more for me," said Dick.

"It's Rosemary I'm thinking of.  She's a natural alcoholic--keeps a
bottle of gin in the bathroom and all that--her mother told me."

He emptied what was left of the first bottle into Rosemary's glass.
She had made herself quite sick the first day in Paris with quarts
of lemonade; after that she had taken nothing with them but now she
raised the champagne and drank at it.

"But what's this?" exclaimed Dick.  "You told me you didn't drink."

"I didn't say I was never going to."

"What about your mother?"

"I'm just going to drink this one glass."  She felt some necessity
for it.  Dick drank, not too much, but he drank, and perhaps it
would bring her closer to him, be a part of the equipment for what
she had to do.  She drank it quickly, choked and then said,
"Besides, yesterday was my birthday--I was eighteen."

"Why didn't you tell us?" they said indignantly.

"I knew you'd make a fuss over it and go to a lot of trouble."  She
finished the champagne.  "So this is the celebration."

"It most certainly is not," Dick assured her.  "The dinner tomorrow
night is your birthday party and don't forget it.  Eighteen--why
that's a terribly important age."

"I used to think until you're eighteen nothing matters," said Mary.

"That's right," Abe agreed.  "And afterward it's the same way."

"Abe feels that nothing matters till he gets on the boat," said
Mary.  "This time he really has got everything planned out when he
gets to New York."  She spoke as though she were tired of saying
things that no longer had a meaning for her, as if in reality the
course that she and her husband followed, or failed to follow, had
become merely an intention.

"He'll be writing music in America and I'll be working at singing
in Munich, so when we get together again there'll be nothing we
can't do."

"That's wonderful," agreed Rosemary, feeling the champagne.

"Meanwhile, another touch of champagne for Rosemary.  Then she'll
be more able to rationalize the acts of her lymphatic glands.  They
only begin to function at eighteen."

Dick laughed indulgently at Abe, whom he loved, and in whom he had
long lost hope:  "That's medically incorrect and we're going."
Catching the faint patronage Abe said lightly:

"Something tells me I'll have a new score on Broadway long before
you've finished your scientific treatise."

"I hope so," said Dick evenly.  "I hope so.  I may even abandon
what you call my 'scientific treatise.'"

"Oh, Dick!"  Mary's voice was startled, was shocked.  Rosemary had
never before seen Dick's face utterly expressionless; she felt that
this announcement was something momentous and she was inclined to
exclaim with Mary "Oh, Dick!"

But suddenly Dick laughed again, added to his remark "--abandon it
for another one," and got up from the table.

"But Dick, sit down.  I want to know--"

"I'll tell you some time.  Good night, Abe.  Good night, Mary."

"Good night, dear Dick."  Mary smiled as if she were going to be
perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat.  She was
a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere,
changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able
to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with
discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction
lay.  And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort
of token. . . .

"What is it you are giving up?" demanded Rosemary, facing Dick
earnestly in the taxi.

"Nothing of importance."

"Are you a scientist?"

"I'm a doctor of medicine."

"Oh-h!" she smiled delightedly.  "My father was a doctor too.  Then
why don't you--" she stopped.

"There's no mystery.  I didn't disgrace myself at the height of my
career, and hide away on the Riviera.  I'm just not practising.
You can't tell, I'll probably practise again some day."

Rosemary put up her face quietly to be kissed.  He looked at her
for a moment as if he didn't understand.  Then holding her in the
hollow of his arm he rubbed his cheek against her cheek's softness,
and then looked down at her for another long moment.

"Such a lovely child," he said gravely.

She smiled up at him; her hands playing conventionally with the
lapels of his coat.  "I'm in love with you and Nicole.  Actually
that's my secret--I can't even talk about you to anybody because I
don't want any more people to know how wonderful you are.
Honestly--I love you and Nicole--I do."

--So many times he had heard this--even the formula was the same.

Suddenly she came toward him, her youth vanishing as she passed
inside the focus of his eyes and he had kissed her breathlessly as
if she were any age at all.  Then she lay back against his arm and
sighed.

"I've decided to give you up," she said.

Dick started--had he said anything to imply that she possessed any
part of him?

"But that's very mean," he managed to say lightly, "just when I was
getting interested."

"I've loved you so--"  As if it had been for years.  She was
weeping a little now.  "I've loved you so-o-o."

Then he should have laughed, but he heard himself saying, "Not only
are you beautiful but you are somehow on the grand scale.
Everything you do, like pretending to be in love or pretending to
be shy gets across."

In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume Rosemary
had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging to him.  He
kissed her without enjoying it.  He knew that there was passion
there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth;
there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath.  She clung
nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by
the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of
contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the
darkness of the world.  She did not know yet that splendor is
something in the heart; at the moment when she realized that and
melted into the passion of the universe he could take her without
question or regret.

Her room in the hotel was diagonally across from theirs and nearer
the elevator.  When they reached the door she said suddenly:

"I know you don't love me--I don't expect it.  But you said I
should have told you about my birthday.  Well, I did, and now for
my birthday present I want you to come into my room a minute while
I tell you something.  Just one minute."

They went in and he closed the door, and Rosemary stood close to
him, not touching him.  The night had drawn the color from her
face--she was pale as pale now, she was a white carnation left
after a dance.

"When you smile--"  He had recovered his paternal attitude, perhaps
because of Nicole's silent proximity, "I always think I'll see a
gap where you've lost some baby teeth."

But he was too late--she came close up against him with a forlorn
whisper.

"Take me."

"Take you where?"

Astonishment froze him rigid.

"Go on," she whispered.  "Oh, please go on, whatever they do.  I
don't care if I don't like it--I never expected to--I've always
hated to think about it but now I don't.  I want you to."

She was astonished at herself--she had never imagined she could
talk like that.  She was calling on things she had read, seen,
dreamed through a decade of convent hours.  Suddenly she knew too
that it was one of her greatest rÃ´les and she flung herself into it
more passionately.

"This is not as it should be," Dick deliberated.  "Isn't it just
the champagne?  Let's more or less forget it."

"Oh, no, NOW.  I want you to do it now, take me, show me, I'm
absolutely yours and I want to be."

"For one thing, have you thought how much it would hurt Nicole?"

"She won't know--this won't have anything to do with her."

He continued kindly.

"Then there's the fact that I love Nicole."

"But you can love more than just one person, can't you?  Like I
love Mother and I love you--more.  I love you more now."

"--the fourth place you're not in love with me but you might be
afterwards, and that would begin your life with a terrible mess."

"No, I promise I'll never see you again.  I'll get Mother and go to
America right away."

He dismissed this.  He was remembering too vividly the youth and
freshness of her lips.  He took another tone.

"You're just in that mood."

"Oh, please, I don't care even if I had a baby.  I could go into
Mexico like a girl at the studio.  Oh, this is so different from
anything I ever thought--I used to hate it when they kissed me
seriously."  He saw she was still under the impression that it must
happen.  "Some of them had great big teeth, but you're all
different and beautiful.  I want you to do it."

"I believe you think people just kiss some way and you want me to
kiss you."

"Oh, don't tease me--I'm not a baby.  I know you're not in love
with me."  She was suddenly humble and quiet.  "I didn't expect
that much.  I know I must seem just nothing to you."

"Nonsense.  But you seem young to me."  His thoughts added, "--
there'd be so much to teach you."

Rosemary waited, breathing eagerly till Dick said:  "And lastly
things aren't arranged so that this could be as you want."

Her face drooped with dismay and disappointment and Dick said
automatically, "We'll have to simply--"  He stopped himself,
followed her to the bed, sat down beside her while she wept.  He
was suddenly confused, not about the ethics of the matter, for the
impossibility of it was sheerly indicated from all angles but
simply confused, and for a moment his usual grace, the tensile
strength of his balance, was absent.

"I knew you wouldn't," she sobbed.  "It was just a forlorn hope."

He stood up.

"Good night, child.  This is a damn shame.  Let's drop it out of
the picture."  He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to
sleep on.  "So many people are going to love you and it might be
nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too.  That's
an old-fashioned idea, isn't it?"  She looked up at him as he took
a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest
idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in
slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a
moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his
coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his
hand fall on the doorknob.  Then she gave up and sank back on the
bed.  When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror, where
she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little.  One hundred and
fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a hundred and fifty
more.  She brushed it until her arm ached, then she changed arms
and went on brushing. . . .

She woke up cooled and shamed.  The sight of her beauty in the
mirror did not reassure her but only awakened the ache of yesterday
and a letter, forwarded by her mother, from the boy who had taken
her to the Yale prom last fall, which announced his presence in
Paris was no help--all that seemed far away.  She emerged from her
room for the ordeal of meeting the Divers weighted with a double
trouble.  But it was hidden by a sheath as impermeable as Nicole's
when they met and went together to a series of fittings.  It was
consoling, though, when Nicole remarked, apropos of a distraught
saleswoman:  "Most people think everybody feels about them much
more violently than they actually do--they think other people's
opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or
disapproval."  Yesterday in her expansiveness Rosemary would have
resented that remark--to-day in her desire to minimize what had
happened she welcomed it eagerly.  She admired Nicole for her
beauty and her wisdom, and also for the first time in her life she
was jealous.  Just before leaving Gausse's hotel her mother had
said in that casual tone, which Rosemary knew concealed her most
significant opinions, that Nicole was a great beauty, with the
frank implication that Rosemary was not.  This did not bother
Rosemary, who had only recently been allowed to learn that she was
even personable; so that her prettiness never seemed exactly her
own but rather an acquirement, like her French.  Nevertheless, in
the taxi she looked at Nicole, matching herself against her.  There
were all the potentialities for romantic love in that lovely body
and in the delicate mouth, sometimes tight, sometimes expectantly
half open to the world.  Nicole had been a beauty as a young girl
and she would be a beauty later when her skin stretched tight over
her high cheekbones--the essential structure was there.  She had
been white-Saxon-blonde but she was more beautiful now that her
hair had darkened than when it had been like a cloud and more
beautiful than she.

"We lived there," Rosemary suddenly pointed to a building in the
Rue des Saints-PÃ©res.

"That's strange.  Because when I was twelve Mother and Baby and I
once spent a winter there," and she pointed to a hotel directly
across the street.  The two dingy fronts stared at them, gray
echoes of girlhood.

"We'd just built our Lake Forest house and we were economizing,"
Nicole continued.  "At least Baby and I and the governess
economized and Mother travelled."

"We were economizing too," said Rosemary, realizing that the word
meant different things to them.

"Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel--"
Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, "--I mean instead of
saying a 'cheap' hotel.  If any swanky friends asked us our address
we'd never say, 'We're in a dingy little hole over in the apache
quarter where we're glad of running water,'--we'd say 'We're in a
small hotel.'  As if all the big ones were too noisy and vulgar for
us.  Of course the friends always saw through us and told everyone
about it, but Mother always said it showed we knew our way around
Europe.  She did, of course: she was born a German citizen.  But
her mother was American, and she was brought up in Chicago, and she
was more American than European."

They were meeting the others in two minutes, and Rosemary
reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the taxi in the
Rue Guynemer, across from the Luxembourg Gardens.  They were
lunching in the Norths' already dismantled apartment high above the
green mass of leaves.  The day seemed different to Rosemary from
the day before--When she saw him face to face their eyes met and
brushed like birds' wings.  After that everything was all right,
everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in
love with her.  She felt wildly happy, felt the warm sap of emotion
being pumped through her body.  A cool, clear confidence deepened
and sang in her.  She scarcely looked at Dick but she knew
everything was all right.

After luncheon the Divers and the Norths and Rosemary went to the
Franco-American Films, to be joined by Collis Clay, her young man
from New Haven, to whom she had telephoned.  He was a Georgian,
with the peculiarly regular, even stencilled ideas of Southerners
who are educated in the North.  Last winter she had thought him
attractive--once they held hands in an automobile going from New
Haven to New York; now he no longer existed for her.

In the projection room she sat between Collis Clay and Dick while
the mechanic mounted the reels of Daddy's Girl and a French
executive fluttered about her trying to talk American slang.  "Yes,
boy," he said when there was trouble with the projector, "I have
not any benenas."  Then the lights went out, there was the sudden
click and a flickering noise and she was alone with Dick at last.
They looked at each other in the half darkness.

"Dear Rosemary," he murmured.  Their shoulders touched.  Nicole
stirred restlessly at the end of the row and Abe coughed
convulsively and blew his nose; then they all settled down and the
picture ran.

There she was--the school girl of a year ago, hair down her back
and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a tanagra figure;
there she was--SO young and innocent--the product of her mother's
loving care; there she was--embodying all the immaturity of the
race, cutting a new cardboard paper doll to pass before its empty
harlot's mind.  She remembered how she had felt in that dress,
especially fresh and new under the fresh young silk.

Daddy's girl.  Was it a 'itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer?
Ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn't she dest too tweet?
Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption rolled away;
nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable became evitable,
syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away.  Women would
forget the dirty dishes at home and weep, even within the picture
one woman wept so long that she almost stole the film away from
Rosemary.  She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan
Phyfe dining-room, in an aviation port, and during a yacht-race
that was only used in two flashes, in a subway and finally in a
bathroom.  But Rosemary triumphed.  Her fineness of character, her
courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity of the
world, and Rosemary showing what it took with a face that had not
yet become mask-like--yet it was actually so moving that the
emotions of the whole row of people went out to her at intervals
during the picture.  There was a break once and the light went on
and after the chatter of applause Dick said to her sincerely:  "I'm
simply astounded.  You're going to be one of the best actresses on
the stage."

Then back to Daddy's Girl: happier days now, and a lovely shot of
Rosemary and her parent united at the last in a father complex so
apparent that Dick winced for all psychologists at the vicious
sentimentality.  The screen vanished, the lights went on, the
moment had come.

"I've arranged one other thing," announced Rosemary to the company
at large, "I've arranged a test for Dick."

"A what?"

"A screen test, they'll take one now."

There was an awful silence--then an irrepressible chortle from the
Norths.  Rosemary watched Dick comprehend what she meant, his face
moving first in an Irish way; simultaneously she realized that she
had made some mistake in the playing of her trump and still she did
not suspect that the card was at fault.

"I don't want a test," said Dick firmly; then, seeing the situation
as a whole, he continued lightly, "Rosemary, I'm disappointed.  The
pictures make a fine career for a woman--but my God, they can't
photograph me.  I'm an old scientist all wrapped up in his private
life."

Nicole and Mary urged him ironically to seize the opportunity; they
teased him, both faintly annoyed at not having been asked for a
sitting.  But Dick closed the subject with a somewhat tart
discussion of actors:  "The strongest guard is placed at the
gateway to nothing," he said.  "Maybe because the condition of
emptiness is too shameful to be divulged."

In the taxi with Dick and Collis Clay--they were dropping Collis,
and Dick was taking Rosemary to a tea from which Nicole and the
Norths had resigned in order to do the things Abe had left undone
till the last--in the taxi Rosemary reproached him.

"I thought if the test turned out to be good I could take it to
California with me.  And then maybe if they liked it you'd come out
and be my leading man in a picture."

He was overwhelmed.  "It was a darn sweet thought, but I'd rather
look at YOU.  You were about the nicest sight I ever looked at."

"That's a great picture," said Collis.  "I've seen it four times.
I know one boy at New Haven who's seen it a dozen times--he went
all the way to Hartford to see it one time.  And when I brought
Rosemary up to New Haven he was so shy he wouldn't meet her.  Can
you beat that?  This little girl knocks them cold."

Dick and Rosemary looked at each other, wanting to be alone, but
Collis failed to understand.

"I'll drop you where you're going," he suggested.  "I'm staying at
the Lutetia."

"We'll drop you," said Dick.

"It'll be easier for me to drop you.  No trouble at all."

"I think it will be better if we drop you."

"But--" began Collis; he grasped the situation at last and began
discussing with Rosemary when he would see her again.

Finally, he was gone, with the shadowy unimportance but the
offensive bulk of the third party.  The car stopped unexpectedly,
unsatisfactorily, at the address Dick had given.  He drew a long
breath.

"Shall we go in?"

"I don't care," Rosemary said.  "I'll do anything you want."

He considered.

"I almost have to go in--she wants to buy some pictures from a
friend of mine who needs the money."

Rosemary smoothed the brief expressive disarray of her hair.

"We'll stay just five minutes," he decided.  "You're not going to
like these people."

She assumed that they were dull and stereotyped people, or gross
and drunken people, or tiresome, insistent people, or any of the
sorts of people that the Divers avoided.  She was entirely
unprepared for the impression that the scene made on her.

It was a house hewn from the frame of Cardinal de Retz's palace in
the Rue Monsieur, but once inside the door there was nothing of the
past, nor of any present that Rosemary knew.  The outer shell, the
masonry, seemed rather to enclose the future so that it was an
electric-like shock, a definite nervous experience, perverted as a
breakfast of oatmeal and hashish, to cross that threshold, if it
could be so called, into the long hall of blue steel, silver-gilt,
and the myriad facets of many oddly bevelled mirrors.  The effect
was unlike that of any part of the Decorative Arts Exhibition--for
there were people IN it, not in front of it.  Rosemary had the
detached false-and-exalted feeling of being on a set and she
guessed that every one else present had that feeling too.

There were about thirty people, mostly women, and all fashioned by
Louisa M. Alcott or Madame de SÃ©gur; and they functioned on this
set as cautiously, as precisely, as does a human hand picking up
jagged broken glass.  Neither individually nor as a crowd could
they be said to dominate the environment, as one comes to dominate
a work of art he may possess, no matter how esoteric, no one knew
what this room meant because it was evolving into something else,
becoming everything a room was not; to exist in it was as difficult
as walking on a highly polished moving stairway, and no one could
succeed at all save with the aforementioned qualities of a hand
moving among broken glass--which qualities limited and defined the
majority of those present.

These were of two sorts.  There were the Americans and English who
had been dissipating all spring and summer, so that now everything
they did had a purely nervous inspiration.  They were very quiet
and lethargic at certain hours and then they exploded into sudden
quarrels and breakdowns and seductions.  The other class, who might
be called the exploiters, was formed by the sponges, who were
sober, serious people by comparison, with a purpose in life and no
time for fooling.  These kept their balance best in that
environment, and what tone there was, beyond the apartment's novel
organization of light values, came from them.

The Frankenstein took down Dick and Rosemary at a gulp--it
separated them immediately and Rosemary suddenly discovered herself
to be an insincere little person, living all in the upper registers
of her throat and wishing the director would come.  There was
however such a wild beating of wings in the room that she did not
feel her position was more incongruous than any one else's.  In
addition, her training told and after a series of semi-military
turns, shifts, and marches she found herself presumably talking to
a neat, slick girl with a lovely boy's face, but actually absorbed
by a conversation taking place on a sort of gun-metal ladder
diagonally opposite her and four feet away.

There was a trio of young women sitting on the bench.  They were
all tall and slender with small heads groomed like manikins' heads,
and as they talked the heads waved gracefully about above their
dark tailored suits, rather like long-stemmed flowers and rather
like cobras' hoods.

"Oh, they give a good show," said one of them, in a deep rich
voice.  "Practically the best show in Paris--I'd be the last one to
deny that.  But after all--"  She sighed.  "Those phrases he uses
over and over--'Oldest inhabitant gnawed by rodents.'  You laugh
once."

"I prefer people whose lives have more corrugated surfaces," said
the second, "and I don't like her."

"I've never really been able to get very excited about them, or
their entourage either.  Why, for example, the entirely liquid Mr.
North?"

"He's out," said the first girl.  "But you must admit that the
party in question can be one of the most charming human beings you
have ever met."

It was the first hint Rosemary had had that they were talking about
the Divers, and her body grew tense with indignation.  But the girl
talking to her, in the starched blue shirt with the bright blue
eyes and the red cheeks and the very gray suit, a poster of a girl,
had begun to play up.  Desperately she kept sweeping things from
between them, afraid that Rosemary couldn't see her, sweeping them
away until presently there was not so much as a veil of brittle
humor hiding the girl, and with distaste Rosemary saw her plain.

"Couldn't you have lunch, or maybe dinner, or lunch the day after?"
begged the girl.  Rosemary looked about for Dick, finding him with
the hostess, to whom he had been talking since they came in.  Their
eyes met and he nodded slightly, and simultaneously the three cobra
women noticed her; their long necks darted toward her and they
fixed finely critical glances upon her.  She looked back at them
defiantly, acknowledging that she had heard what they said.  Then
she threw off her exigent vis-Ã -vis with a polite but clipped
parting that she had just learned from Dick, and went over to join
him.  The hostess--she was another tall rich American girl,
promenading insouciantly upon the national prosperity--was asking
Dick innumerable questions about Gausse's HÃ´tel, whither she
evidently wanted to come, and battering persistently against his
reluctance.  Rosemary's presence reminded her that she had been
recalcitrant as a hostess and glancing about she said:  "Have you
met any one amusing, have you met Mr.--"  Her eyes groped for a
male who might interest Rosemary, but Dick said they must go.  They
left immediately, moving over the brief threshold of the future to
the sudden past of the stone faÃ§ade without.

"Wasn't it terrible?" he said.

"Terrible," she echoed obediently.

"Rosemary?"

She murmured, "What?" in an awed voice.

"I feel terribly about this."

She was shaken with audibly painful sobs.  "Have you got a
handkerchief?" she faltered.  But there was little time to cry, and
lovers now they fell ravenously on the quick seconds while outside
the taxi windows the green and cream twilight faded, and the fire-
red, gas-blue, ghost-green signs began to shine smokily through the
tranquil rain.  It was nearly six, the streets were in movement,
the bistros gleamed, the Place de la Concorde moved by in pink
majesty as the cab turned north.

They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a
spell.  Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more
slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the
mind.

"I don't know what came over me last night," Rosemary said.  "That
glass of champagne?  I've never done anything like that before."

"You simply said you loved me."

"I do love you--I can't change that."  It was time for Rosemary to
cry, so she cried a little in her handkerchief.

"I'm afraid I'm in love with you," said Dick, "and that's not the
best thing that could happen."

Again the names--then they lurched together as if the taxi had
swung them.  Her breasts crushed flat against him, her mouth was
all new and warm, owned in common.  They stopped thinking with an
almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and
sought each other.  They were both in the gray gentle world of a
mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like
piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs.  Nerves so
raw and tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips, breast
to breast. . . .

They were still in the happier stage of love.  They were full of
brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the
communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other
human relations mattered.  They both seemed to have arrived there
with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure
accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last
they were forced to conclude that they were for each other.  They
had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic
with the merely curious and clandestine.

But for Dick that portion of the road was short; the turning came
before they reached the hotel.

"There's nothing to do about it," he said, with a feeling of panic.
"I'm in love with you but it doesn't change what I said last
night."

"That doesn't matter now.  I just wanted to make you love me--if
you love me everything's all right."

"Unfortunately I do.  But Nicole mustn't know--she mustn't suspect
even faintly.  Nicole and I have got to go on together.  In a way
that's more important than just wanting to go on."

"Kiss me once more."

He kissed her, but momentarily he had left her.

"Nicole mustn't suffer--she loves me and I love her--you understand
that."

She did understand--it was the sort of thing she understood well,
not hurting people.  She knew the Divers loved each other because
it had been her primary assumption.  She had thought however that
it was a rather cooled relation, and actually rather like the love
of herself and her mother.  When people have so much for outsiders
didn't it indicate a lack of inner intensity?

"And I mean love," he said, guessing her thoughts.  "Active love--
it's more complicated than I can tell you.  It was responsible for
that crazy duel."

"How did you know about the duel?  I thought we were to keep it
from you."

"Do you think Abe can keep a secret?"  He spoke with incisive
irony.  "Tell a secret over the radio, publish it in a tabloid, but
never tell it to a man who drinks more than three or four a day."

She laughed in agreement, staying close to him.

"So you understand my relations with Nicole are complicated.  She's
not very strong--she looks strong but she isn't.  And this makes
rather a mess."

"Oh, say that later!  But kiss me now--love me now.  I'll love you
and never let Nicole see."

"You darling."

They reached the hotel and Rosemary walked a little behind him, to
admire him, to adore him.  His step was alert as if he had just
come from some great doings and was hurrying on toward others.
Organizer of private gaiety, curator of a richly incrusted
happiness.  His hat was a perfect hat and he carried a heavy stick
and yellow gloves.  She thought what a good time they would all
have being with him to-night.

They walked upstairs--five flights.  At the first landing they
stopped and kissed; she was careful on the next landing, on the
third more careful still.  On the next--there were two more--she
stopped half way and kissed him fleetingly good-by.  At his urgency
she walked down with him to the one below for a minute--and then up
and up.  Finally it was good-by with their hands stretching to
touch along the diagonal of the banister and then the fingers
slipping apart.  Dick went back downstairs to make some
arrangements for the evening--Rosemary ran to her room and wrote a
letter to her mother; she was conscience-stricken because she did
not miss her mother at all.

Although the Divers were honestly apathetic to organized fashion,
they were nevertheless too acute to abandon its contemporaneous
rhythm and beat--Dick's parties were all concerned with excitement,
and a chance breath of fresh night air was the more precious for
being experienced in the intervals of the excitement.

The party that night moved with the speed of a slapstick comedy.
They were twelve, they were sixteen, they were quartets in separate
motors bound on a quick Odyssey over Paris.  Everything had been
foreseen.  People joined them as if by magic, accompanied them as
specialists, almost guides, through a phase of the evening, dropped
out and were succeeded by other people, so that it appeared as if
the freshness of each one had been husbanded for them all day.
Rosemary appreciated how different it was from any party in
Hollywood, no matter how splendid in scale.  There was, among many
diversions, the car of the Shah of Persia.  Where Dick had
commandeered this vehicle, what bribery was employed, these were
facts of irrelevance.  Rosemary accepted it as merely a new facet
of the fabulous, which for two years had filled her life.  The car
had been built on a special chassis in America.  Its wheels were of
silver, so was the radiator.  The inside of the body was inlaid
with innumerable brilliants which would be replaced with true gems
by the court jeweller when the car arrived in Teheran the following
week.  There was only one real seat in back, because the Shah must
ride alone, so they took turns riding in it and sitting on the
marten fur that covered the floor.

But always there was Dick.  Rosemary assured the image of her
mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had she known any
one so nice, so thoroughly nice as Dick was that night.  She
compared him with the two Englishmen, whom Abe addressed
conscientiously as "Major Hengest and Mr. Horsa," and with the heir
to a Scandinavian throne and the novelist just back from Russia,
and with Abe, who was desperate and witty, and with Collis Clay,
who joined them somewhere and stayed along--and felt there was no
comparison.  The enthusiasm, the selflessness behind the whole
performance ravished her, the technic of moving many varied types,
each as immobile, as dependent on supplies of attention as an
infantry battalion is dependent on rations, appeared so effortless
that he still had pieces of his own most personal self for
everyone.

--Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the
happiest.  The first time was when she and Dick danced together and
she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong form
as they floated, hovering like people in an amusing dream--he
turned her here and there with such a delicacy of suggestion that
she was like a bright bouquet, a piece of precious cloth being
displayed before fifty eyes.  There was a moment when they were not
dancing at all, simply clinging together.  Some time in the early
morning they were alone, and her damp powdery young body came up
close to him in a crush of tired cloth, and stayed there, crushed
against a background of other people's hats and wraps. . . .

The time she laughed most was later, when six of them, the best of
them, noblest relics of the evening, stood in the dusky front lobby
of the Ritz telling the night concierge that General Pershing was
outside and wanted caviare and champagne.  "He brooks no delay.
Every man, every gun is at his service."  Frantic waiters emerged
from nowhere, a table was set in the lobby, and Abe came in
representing General Pershing while they stood up and mumbled
remembered fragments of war songs at him.  In the waiters' injured
reaction to this anti-climax they found themselves neglected, so
they built a waiter trap--a huge and fantastic device constructed
of all the furniture in the lobby and functioning like one of the
bizarre machines of a Goldberg cartoon.  Abe shook his head
doubtfully at it.

"Perhaps it would be better to steal a musical saw and--"

"That's enough," Mary interrupted.  "When Abe begins bringing up
that it's time to go home."  Anxiously she confided to Rosemary:

"I've got to get Abe home.  His boat train leaves at eleven.  It's
so important--I feel the whole future depends on his catching it,
but whenever I argue with him he does the exact opposite."

"I'll try and persuade him," offered Rosemary.

"Would you?" Mary said doubtfully.  "Maybe you could."

Then Dick came up to Rosemary:

"Nicole and I are going home and we thought you'd want to go with
us."

Her face was pale with fatigue in the false dawn.  Two wan dark
spots in her cheek marked where the color was by day.

"I can't," she said.  "I promised Mary North to stay along with
them--or Abe'll never go to bed.  Maybe you could do something."

"Don't you know you can't do anything about people?" he advised
her.  "If Abe was my room-mate in college, tight for the first
time, it'd be different.  Now there's nothing to do."

"Well, I've got to stay.  He says he'll go to bed if we only come
to the Halles with him," she said, almost defiantly.

He kissed the inside of her elbow quickly.

"Don't let Rosemary go home alone," Nicole called to Mary as they
left.  "We feel responsible to her mother."

--Later Rosemary and the Norths and a manufacturer of dolls' voices
from Newark and ubiquitous Collis and a big splendidly dressed oil
Indian named George T. Horseprotection were riding along on top of
thousands of carrots in a market wagon.  The earth in the carrot
beards was fragrant and sweet in the darkness, and Rosemary was so
high up in the load that she could hardly see the others in the
long shadow between infrequent street lamps.  Their voices came
from far off, as if they were having experiences different from
hers, different and far away, for she was with Dick in her heart,
sorry she had come with the Norths, wishing she was at the hotel
and him asleep across the hall, or that he was here beside her with
the warm darkness streaming down.

"Don't come up," she called to Collis, "the carrots will all roll."
She threw one at Abe who was sitting beside the driver, stiffly
like an old man. . . .

Later she was homeward bound at last in broad daylight, with the
pigeons already breaking over Saint-Sulpice.  All of them began to
laugh spontaneously because they knew it was still last night while
the people in the streets had the delusion that it was bright hot
morning.

"At last I've been on a wild party," thought Rosemary, "but it's no
fun when Dick isn't there."

She felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving object
came into sight.  It was a huge horse-chestnut tree in full bloom
bound for the Champs ÃlysÃ©es, strapped now into a long truck and
simply shaking with laughter--like a lovely person in an
undignified position yet confident none the less of being lovely.
Looking at it with fascination Rosemary identified herself with it,
and laughed cheerfully with it, and everything all at once seemed
gorgeous.

Abe left from the Gare Saint Lazare at eleven--he stood alone under
the fouled glass dome, relic of the seventies, era of the Crystal
Palace; his hands, of that vague gray color that only twenty-four
hours can produce, were in his coat pockets to conceal the
trembling fingers.  With his hat removed it was plain that only the
top layer of his hair was brushed back--the lower levels were
pointed resolutely sidewise.  He was scarcely recognizable as the
man who had swum upon Gausse's Beach a fortnight ago.

He was early; he looked from left to right with his eyes only; it
would have taken nervous forces out of his control to use any other
part of his body.  New-looking baggage went past him; presently
prospective passengers, with dark little bodies, were calling:
"Jew-uls-HOO-OO!" in dark piercing voices.

At the minute when he wondered whether or not he had time for a
drink at the buffet, and began clutching at the soggy wad of
thousand-franc notes in his pocket, one end of his pendulous glance
came to rest upon the apparition of Nicole at the stairhead.  He
watched her--she was self-revelatory in her little expressions as
people seem to some one waiting for them, who as yet is himself
unobserved.  She was frowning, thinking of her children, less
gloating over them than merely animally counting them--a cat
checking her cubs with a paw.

When she saw Abe, the mood passed out of her face; the glow of the
morning skylight was sad, and Abe made a gloomy figure with dark
circles that showed through the crimson tan under his eyes.  They
sat down on a bench.

"I came because you asked me," said Nicole defensively.  Abe seemed
to have forgotten why he asked her and Nicole was quite content to
look at the travellers passing by.

"That's going to be the belle of your boat--that one with all the
men to say good-by--you see why she bought that dress?"  Nicole
talked faster and faster.  "You see why nobody else would buy it
except the belle of the world cruise?  See?  No?  Wake up!  That's
a story dress--that extra material tells a story and somebody on
world cruise would be lonesome enough to want to hear it."

She bit close her last words; she had talked too much for her; and
Abe found it difficult to gather from her serious set face that she
had spoken at all.  With an effort he drew himself up to a posture
that looked as if he were standing up while he was sitting down.

"The afternoon you took me to that funny ball--you know, St.
Genevieve's--" he began.

"I remember.  It was fun, wasn't it?"

"No fun for me.  I haven't had fun seeing you this time.  I'm tired
of you both, but it doesn't show because you're even more tired of
me--you know what I mean.  If I had any enthusiasm, I'd go on to
new people."

There was a rough nap on Nicole's velvet gloves as she slapped him
back:

"Seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, Abe.  Anyhow you don't mean
that.  I can't see why you've given up about everything."

Abe considered, trying hard not to cough or blow his nose.

"I suppose I got bored; and then it was such a long way to go back
in order to get anywhere."

Often a man can play the helpless child in front of a woman, but he
can almost never bring it off when he feels most like a helpless
child.

"No excuse for it," Nicole said crisply.

Abe was feeling worse every minute--he could think of nothing but
disagreeable and sheerly nervous remarks.  Nicole thought that the
correct attitude for her was to sit staring straight ahead, hands
in her lap.  For a while there was no communication between them--
each was racing away from the other, breathing only insofar as
there was blue space ahead, a sky not seen by the other.  Unlike
lovers they possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they possessed
no future; yet up to this morning Nicole had liked Abe better than
any one except Dick--and he had been heavy, belly-frightened, with
love for her for years.

"Tired of women's worlds," he spoke up suddenly.

"Then why don't you make a world of your own?"

"Tired of friends.  The thing is to have sycophants."

Nicole tried to force the minute hand around on the station clock,
but, "You agree?" he demanded.

"I am a woman and my business is to hold things together."

"My business is to tear them apart."

"When you get drunk you don't tear anything apart except yourself,"
she said, cold now, and frightened and unconfident.  The station
was filling but no one she knew came.  After a moment her eyes fell
gratefully on a tall girl with straw hair like a helmet, who was
dropping letters in the mail slot.

"A girl I have to speak to, Abe.  Abe, wake up!  You fool!"

Patiently Abe followed her with his eyes.  The woman turned in a
startled way to greet Nicole, and Abe recognized her as some one he
had seen around Paris.  He took advantage of Nicole's absence to
cough hard and retchingly into his handkerchief, and to blow his
nose loud.  The morning was warmer and his underwear was soaked
with sweat.  His fingers trembled so violently that it took four
matches to light a cigarette; it seemed absolutely necessary to
make his way into the buffet for a drink, but immediately Nicole
returned.

"That was a mistake," she said with frosty humor.  "After begging
me to come and see her, she gave me a good snubbing.  She looked at
me as if I were rotted."  Excited, she did a little laugh, as with
two fingers high in the scales.  "Let people come to you."

Abe recovered from a cigarette cough and remarked:

"Trouble is when you're sober you don't want to see anybody, and
when you're tight nobody wants to see you."

"Who, me?"  Nicole laughed again; for some reason the late
encounter had cheered her.

"No--me."

"Speak for yourself.  I like people, a lot of people--I like--"

Rosemary and Mary North came in sight, walking slowly and searching
for Abe, and Nicole burst forth grossly with "Hey!  Hi!  Hey!" and
laughed and waved the package of handkerchiefs she had bought for
Abe.

They stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted down by Abe's
gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like the wreck of a galleon,
dominating with his presence his own weakness and self-indulgence,
his narrowness and bitterness.  All of them were conscious of the
solemn dignity that flowed from him, of his achievement,
fragmentary, suggestive and surpassed.  But they were frightened at
his survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.

Dick Diver came and brought with him a fine glowing surface on
which the three women sprang like monkeys with cries of relief,
perching on his shoulders, on the beautiful crown of his hat or the
gold head of his cane.  Now, for a moment, they could disregard the
spectacle of Abe's gigantic obscenity.  Dick saw the situation
quickly and grasped it quietly.  He pulled them out of themselves
into the station, making plain its wonders.  Nearby, some Americans
were saying good-by in voices that mimicked the cadence of water
running into a large old bathtub.  Standing in the station, with
Paris in back of them, it seemed as if they were vicariously
leaning a little over the ocean, already undergoing a sea-change, a
shifting about of atoms to form the essential molecule of a new
people.

So the well-to-do Americans poured through the station onto the
platforms with frank new faces, intelligent, considerate,
thoughtless, thought-for.  An occasional English face among them
seemed sharp and emergent.  When there were enough Americans on the
platform the first impression of their immaculacy and their money
began to fade into a vague racial dusk that hindered and blinded
both them and their observers.

Nicole seized Dick's arm crying, "Look!"  Dick turned in time to
see what took place in half a minute.  At a Pullman entrance two
cars off, a vivid scene detached itself from the tenor of many
farewells.  The young woman with the helmet-like hair to whom
Nicole had spoken made an odd dodging little run away from the man
to whom she was talking and plunged a frantic hand into her purse;
then the sound of two revolver shots cracked the narrow air of the
platform.  Simultaneously the engine whistled sharply and the train
began to move, momentarily dwarfing the shots in significance.  Abe
waved again from his window, oblivious to what had happened.  But
before the crowd closed in, the others had seen the shots take
effect, seen the target sit down upon the platform.

Only after a hundred years did the train stop; Nicole, Mary, and
Rosemary waited on the outskirts while Dick fought his way through.
It was five minutes before he found them again--by this time the
crowd had split into two sections, following, respectively, the man
on a stretcher and the girl walking pale and firm between
distraught gendarmes.

"It was Maria Wallis," Dick said hurriedly.  "The man she shot was
an Englishman--they had an awful time finding out who, because she
shot him through his identification card."  They were walking
quickly from the train, swayed along with the crowd.  "I found out
what poste de police they're taking her to so I'll go there--"

"But her sister lives in Paris," Nicole objected.  "Why not phone
her?  Seems very peculiar nobody thought of that.  She's married to
a Frenchman, and he can do more than we can."

Dick hesitated, shook his head and started off.

"Wait!" Nicole cried after him.  "That's foolish--how can you do
any good--with your French?"

"At least I'll see they don't do anything outrageous to her."

"They're certainly going to hold on to her," Nicole assured him
briskly.  "She DID shoot the man.  The best thing is to phone right
away to Laura--she can do more than we can."

Dick was unconvinced--also he was showing off for Rosemary.

"You wait," said Nicole firmly, and hurried off to a telephone
booth.

"When Nicole takes things into her hands," he said with affectionate
irony, "there is nothing more to be done."

He saw Rosemary for the first time that morning.  They exchanged
glances, trying to recognize the emotions of the day before.  For a
moment each seemed unreal to the other--then the slow warm hum of
love began again.

"You like to help everybody, don't you?" Rosemary said.

"I only pretend to."

"Mother likes to help everybody--of course she can't help as many
people as you do."  She sighed.  "Sometimes I think I'm the most
selfish person in the world."

For the first time the mention of her mother annoyed rather than
amused Dick.  He wanted to sweep away her mother, remove the whole
affair from the nursery footing upon which Rosemary persistently
established it.  But he realized that this impulse was a loss of
control--what would become of Rosemary's urge toward him if, for
even a moment, he relaxed.  He saw, not without panic, that the
affair was sliding to rest; it could not stand still, it must go on
or go back; for the first time it occurred to him that Rosemary had
her hand on the lever more authoritatively than he.

Before he had thought out a course of procedure, Nicole returned.

"I found Laura.  It was the first news she had and her voice kept
fading away and then getting loud again--as if she was fainting and
then pulling herself together.  She said she knew something was
going to happen this morning."

"Maria ought to be with Diaghileff," said Dick in a gentle tone, in
order to bring them back to quietude.  "She has a nice sense of
decor--not to say rhythm.  Will any of us ever see a train pulling
out without hearing a few shots?"

They bumped down the wide steel steps.  "I'm sorry for the poor
man," Nicole said.  "Course that's why she talked so strange to me--
she was getting ready to open fire."

She laughed, Rosemary laughed too, but they were both horrified,
and both of them deeply wanted Dick to make a moral comment on the
matter and not leave it to them.  This wish was not entirely
conscious, especially on the part of Rosemary, who was accustomed
to having shell fragments of such events shriek past her head.  But
a totality of shock had piled up in her too.  For the moment, Dick
was too shaken by the impetus of his newly recognized emotion to
resolve things into the pattern of the holiday, so the women,
missing something, lapsed into a vague unhappiness.

Then, as if nothing had happened, the lives of the Divers and their
friends flowed out into the street.

However, everything had happened--Abe's departure and Mary's
impending departure for Salzburg this afternoon had ended the time
in Paris.  Or perhaps the shots, the concussions that had finished
God knew what dark matter, had terminated it.  The shots had
entered into all their lives: echoes of violence followed them out
onto the pavement where two porters held a post-mortem beside them
as they waited for a taxi.

"Tu as vu le revolver?  Il Ã©tait trÃ¨s petit, vraie perle--un
jouet."

"Mais, assez puissant!" said the other porter sagely.  "Tu as vu sa
chemise?  Assez de sang pour se croire Ã  la guerre."

In the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline
exhaust cooked slowly in the July sun.  It was a terrible thing--
unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape but suggested
only roads choked with the same foul asthma.  During their
luncheon, outdoors, across from the Luxembourg Gardens, Rosemary
had cramps and felt fretful and full of impatient lassitude--it was
the foretaste of this that had inspired her self-accusation of
selfishness in the station.

Dick had no suspicion of the sharpness of the change; he was
profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of egotism tended
momentarily to blind him to what was going on round about him, and
deprive him of the long ground-swell of imagination that he counted
on for his judgments.

After Mary North left them, accompanied by the Italian singing
teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking her to her
train, Rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an engagement at her
studio: "meet some officials."

"And oh--" she proposed "--if Collis Clay, that Southern boy--if he
comes while you are still sitting here, just tell him I couldn't
wait; tell him to call me to-morrow."

Too insouciant, in reaction from the late disturbance, she had
assumed the privileges of a child--the result being to remind the
Divers of their exclusive love for their own children; Rosemary was
sharply rebuked in a short passage between the women:  "You'd
better leave the message with a waiter," Nicole's voice was stern
and unmodulated, "we're leaving immediately."

Rosemary got it, took it without resentment.

"I'll let it go then.  Good-by, you darlings."

Dick asked for the check; the Divers relaxed, chewing tentatively
on toothpicks.

"Well--" they said together.

He saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that only he
would have noticed, and he could pretend not to have seen.  What
did Nicole think?  Rosemary was one of a dozen people he had
"worked over" in the past years: these had included a French circus
clown, Abe and Mary North, a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter,
a comedienne from the Grand Guignol, a half-crazy pederast from the
Russian Ballet, a promising tenor they had staked to a year in
Milan.  Nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his
interest and enthusiasm; but she realized also that, except while
their children were being born, Dick had not spent a night apart
from her since their marriage.  On the other hand, there was a
pleasingness about him that simply had to be used--those who
possessed that pleasingness had to keep their hands in, and go
along attaching people that they had no use to make of.

Now Dick hardened himself and let minutes pass without making any
gesture of confidence, any representation of constantly renewed
surprise that they were one together.

Collis Clay out of the South edged a passage between the closely
packed tables and greeted the Divers cavalierly.  Such salutations
always astonished Dick--acquaintances saying "Hi!" to them, or
speaking only to one of them.  He felt so intensely about people
that in moments of apathy he preferred to remain concealed; that
one could parade a casualness into his presence was a challenge to
the key on which he lived.

Collis, unaware that he was without a wedding garment, heralded his
arrival with:  "I reckon I'm late--the beyed has flown."  Dick had
to wrench something out of himself before he could forgive him for
not having first complimented Nicole.

She left almost immediately and he sat with Collis, finishing the
last of his wine.  He rather liked Collis--he was "post-war"; less
difficult than most of the Southerners he had known at New Haven
a decade previously.  Dick listened with amusement to the
conversation that accompanied the slow, profound stuffing of a
pipe.  In the early afternoon children and nurses were trekking
into the Luxembourg Gardens; it was the first time in months that
Dick had let this part of the day out of his hands.

Suddenly his blood ran cold as he realized the content of Collis's
confidential monologue.

"--she's not so cold as you'd probably think.  I admit I thought
she was cold for a long time.  But she got into a jam with a friend
of mine going from New York to Chicago at Easter--a boy named
Hillis she thought was pretty nutsey at New Haven--she had a
compartment with a cousin of mine but she and Hillis wanted to be
alone, so in the afternoon my cousin came and played cards in our
compartment.  Well, after about two hours we went back and there
was Rosemary and Bill Hillis standing in the vestibule arguing with
the conductor--Rosemary white as a sheet.  Seems they locked the
door and pulled down the blinds and I guess there was some heavy
stuff going on when the conductor came for the tickets and knocked
on the door.  They thought it was us kidding them and wouldn't let
him in at first, and when they did, he was plenty sore.  He asked
Hillis if that was his compartment and whether he and Rosemary were
married that they locked the door, and Hillis lost his temper
trying to explain there was nothing wrong.  He said the conductor
had insulted Rosemary and he wanted him to fight, but that
conductor could have made trouble--and believe me I had an awful
time smoothing it over."

With every detail imagined, with even envy for the pair's community
of misfortune in the vestibule, Dick felt a change taking place
within him.  Only the image of a third person, even a vanished one,
entering into his relation with Rosemary was needed to throw him
off his balance and send through him waves of pain, misery, desire,
desperation.  The vividly pictured hand on Rosemary's cheek, the
quicker breath, the white excitement of the event viewed from
outside, the inviolable secret warmth within.

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

--Please do.  It's too light in here.

Collis Clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at New
Haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis.  Dick had gathered
that he was in love with Rosemary in some curious way Dick could
not have understood.  The affair with Hillis seemed to have made no
emotional impression on Collis save to give him the joyful
conviction that Rosemary was "human."

"Bones got a wonderful crowd," he said.  "We all did, as a matter
of fact.  New Haven's so big now the sad thing is the men we have
to leave out."

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

--Please do.  It's too light in here.

. . . Dick went over Paris to his bank--writing a check, he looked
along the row of men at the desks deciding to which one he would
present it for an O.K.  As he wrote he engrossed himself in the
material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously
upon the high glass-topped desk.  Once he raised glazed eyes to
look toward the mail department, then glazed his spirit again by
concentration upon the objects he dealt with.

Still he failed to decide to whom the check should be presented,
which man in the line would guess least of the unhappy predicament
in which he found himself and, also, which one would be least
likely to talk.  There was Perrin, the suave New Yorker, who had
asked him to luncheons at the American Club, there was Casasus, the
Spaniard, with whom he usually discussed a mutual friend in spite
of the fact that the friend had passed out of his life a dozen
years before; there was Muchhause, who always asked him whether he
wanted to draw upon his wife's money or his own.

As he entered the amount on the stub, and drew two lines under it,
he decided to go to Pierce, who was young and for whom he would
have to put on only a small show.  It was often easier to give a
show than to watch one.

He went to the mail desk first--as the woman who served him pushed
up with her bosom a piece of paper that had nearly escaped the
desk, he thought how differently women use their bodies from men.
He took his letters aside to open: There was a bill for seventeen
psychiatric books from a German concern, a bill from Brentano's, a
letter from Buffalo from his father, in a handwriting that year by
year became more indecipherable; there was a card from Tommy Barban
postmarked Fez and bearing a facetious communication; there were
letters from doctors in Zurich, both in German; a disputed bill
from a plasterer in Cannes; a bill from a furniture maker; a letter
from the publisher of a medical journal in Baltimore, miscellaneous
announcements and an invitation to a showing of pictures by an
incipient artist; also there were three letters for Nicole, and a
letter for Rosemary sent in his care.

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

He went toward Pierce but he was engaged with a woman, and Dick saw
with his heels that he would have to present his check to Casasus
at the next desk, who was free.

"How are you, Diver?"  Casasus was genial.  He stood up, his
mustache spreading with his smile.  "We were talking about
Featherstone the other day and I thought of you--he's out in
California now."

Dick widened his eyes and bent forward a little.

"In Cali-FOR-nia?"

"That's what I heard."

Dick held the check poised; to focus the attention of Casasus upon
it he looked toward Pierce's desk, holding the latter for a moment
in a friendly eye-play conditioned by an old joke of three years
before when Pierce had been involved with a Lithuanian countess.
Pierce played up with a grin until Casasus had authorized the check
and had no further recourse to detain Dick, whom he liked, than to
stand up holding his pince-nez and repeat, "Yes, he's in
California."

Meanwhile Dick had seen that Perrin, at the head of the line of
desks, was in conversation with the heavyweight champion of the
world; from a sidesweep of Perrin's eye Dick saw that he was
considering calling him over and introducing him, but that he
finally decided against it.

Cutting across the social mood of Casasus with the intensity he had
accumulated at the glass desk--which is to say he looked hard at
the check, studying it, and then fixed his eyes on grave problems
beyond the first marble pillar to the right of the banker's head
and made a business of shifting the cane, hat, and letters he
carried--he said good-by and went out.  He had long ago purchased
the doorman; his taxi sprang to the curb.

"I want to go to the Films Par Excellence Studio--it's on a little
street in Passy.  Go to the Muette.  I'll direct you from there."

He was rendered so uncertain by the events of the last forty-eight
hours that he was not even sure of what he wanted to do; he paid
off the taxi at the Muette and walked in the direction of the
studio, crossing to the opposite side of the street before he came
to the building.  Dignified in his fine clothes, with their fine
accessories, he was yet swayed and driven as an animal.  Dignity
could come only with an overthrowing of his past, of the effort of
the last six years.  He went briskly around the block with the
fatuousness of one of Tarkington's adolescents, hurrying at the
blind places lest he miss Rosemary's coming out of the studio.  It
was a melancholy neighborhood.  Next door to the place he saw a
sign:  "1000 chemises."  The shirts filled the window, piled,
cravated, stuffed, or draped with shoddy grace on the showcase
floor:  "1000 chemises"--count them!  On either side he read:
"Papeterie," "PÃ¢tisserie," "Solde," "RÃ©clame"--and Constance
Talmadge in "DÃ©jeuner de Soleil," and farther away there were more
sombre announcements:  "VÃªtements EcclÃ©siastiques," "DÃ©claration de
DÃ©cÃ¨s" and "Pompes FunÃ¨bres."  Life and death.

He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in his
life--it was out of line with everything that had preceded it--even
out of line with what effect he might hope to produce upon
Rosemary.  Rosemary saw him always as a model of correctness--his
presence walking around this block was an intrusion.  But Dick's
necessity of behaving as he did was a projection of some submerged
reality: he was compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirt-
sleeve fitting his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirt-
sleeve like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his
neck, his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small
briefcase like a dandy--just as another man once found it necessary
to stand in front of a church in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes.
Dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten, unshriven,
unexpurgated.

In the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline
exhaust cooked slowly in the July sun.  It was a terrible thing--
unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape but suggested
only roads choked with the same foul asthma.  During their

momentarily to blind him to what was going on round about him, and
deprive him of the long ground-swell of imagination that he counted

After Mary North left them, accompanied by the Italian singing
teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking her to her
train, Rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an engagement at her
studio: "meet some officials."

"And oh--" she proposed "--if Collis Clay, that Southern boy--if he

He saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that only he

"worked over" in the past years: these had included a French circus
clown, Abe and Mary North, a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter,
a comedienne from the Grand Guignol, a half-crazy pederast from the
Russian Ballet, a promising tenor they had staked to a year in
Milan.  Nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his

him in at first, and when they did, he was plenty sore.  He asked
Hillis if that was his compartment and whether he and Rosemary were
married that they locked the door, and Hillis lost his temper
trying to explain there was nothing wrong.  He said the conductor
had insulted Rosemary and he wanted him to fight, but that
conductor could have made trouble--and believe me I had an awful
time smoothing it over."

With every detail imagined, with even envy for the pair's community
of misfortune in the vestibule, Dick felt a change taking place
within him.  Only the image of a third person, even a vanished one,
entering into his relation with Rosemary was needed to throw him
off his balance and send through him waves of pain, misery, desire,
desperation.  The vividly pictured hand on Rosemary's cheek, the
quicker breath, the white excitement of the event viewed from
outside, the inviolable secret warmth within.

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

--Please do.  It's too light in here.

Collis Clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at New
Haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis.  Dick had gathered
that he was in love with Rosemary in some curious way Dick could
not have understood.  The affair with Hillis seemed to have made no
emotional impression on Collis save to give him the joyful
conviction that Rosemary was "human."

"Bones got a wonderful crowd," he said.  "We all did, as a matter
of fact.  New Haven's so big now the sad thing is the men we have
to leave out."

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

--Please do.  It's too light in here.

. . . Dick went over Paris to his bank--writing a check, he looked
along the row of men at the desks deciding to which one he would
present it for an O.K.  As he wrote he engrossed himself in the
material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously
upon the high glass-topped desk.  Once he raised glazed eyes to
look toward the mail department, then glazed his spirit again by
concentration upon the objects he dealt with.

Still he failed to decide to whom the check should be presented,
which man in the line would guess least of the unhappy predicament
in which he found himself and, also, which one would be least
likely to talk.  There was Perrin, the suave New Yorker, who had
asked him to luncheons at the American Club, there was Casasus, the
Spaniard, with whom he usually discussed a mutual friend in spite
of the fact that the friend had passed out of his life a dozen
years before; there was Muchhause, who always asked him whether he
wanted to draw upon his wife's money or his own.

As he entered the amount on the stub, and drew two lines under it,
he decided to go to Pierce, who was young and for whom he would
have to put on only a small show.  It was often easier to give a
show than to watch one.

He went to the mail desk first--as the woman who served him pushed
up with her bosom a piece of paper that had nearly escaped the
desk, he thought how differently women use their bodies from men.
He took his letters aside to open: There was a bill for seventeen
psychiatric books from a German concern, a bill from Brentano's, a
letter from Buffalo from his father, in a handwriting that year by
year became more indecipherable; there was a card from Tommy Barban
postmarked Fez and bearing a facetious communication; there were
letters from doctors in Zurich, both in German; a disputed bill
from a plasterer in Cannes; a bill from a furniture maker; a letter
from the publisher of a medical journal in Baltimore, miscellaneous
announcements and an invitation to a showing of pictures by an
incipient artist; also there were three letters for Nicole, and a
letter for Rosemary sent in his care.

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

He went toward Pierce but he was engaged with a woman, and Dick saw
with his heels that he would have to present his check to Casasus
at the next desk, who was free.

"How are you, Diver?"  Casasus was genial.  He stood up, his
mustache spreading with his smile.  "We were talking about
Featherstone the other day and I thought of you--he's out in
California now."

Dick widened his eyes and bent forward a little.

"In Cali-FOR-nia?"

"That's what I heard."

Dick held the check poised; to focus the attention of Casasus upon
it he looked toward Pierce's desk, holding the latter for a moment
in a friendly eye-play conditioned by an old joke of three years
before when Pierce had been involved with a Lithuanian countess.
Pierce played up with a grin until Casasus had authorized the check
and had no further recourse to detain Dick, whom he liked, than to
stand up holding his pince-nez and repeat, "Yes, he's in
California."

Meanwhile Dick had seen that Perrin, at the head of the line of
desks, was in conversation with the heavyweight champion of the
world; from a sidesweep of Perrin's eye Dick saw that he was
considering calling him over and introducing him, but that he
finally decided against it.

Cutting across the social mood of Casasus with the intensity he had
accumulated at the glass desk--which is to say he looked hard at
the check, studying it, and then fixed his eyes on grave problems
beyond the first marble pillar to the right of the banker's head
and made a business of shifting the cane, hat, and letters he
carried--he said good-by and went out.  He had long ago purchased
the doorman; his taxi sprang to the curb.

"I want to go to the Films Par Excellence Studio--it's on a little
street in Passy.  Go to the Muette.  I'll direct you from there."

He was rendered so uncertain by the events of the last forty-eight
hours that he was not even sure of what he wanted to do; he paid
off the taxi at the Muette and walked in the direction of the
studio, crossing to the opposite side of the street before he came
to the building.  Dignified in his fine clothes, with their fine
accessories, he was yet swayed and driven as an animal.  Dignity
could come only with an overthrowing of his past, of the effort of
the last six years.  He went briskly around the block with the
fatuousness of one of Tarkington's adolescents, hurrying at the
blind places lest he miss Rosemary's coming out of the studio.  It
was a melancholy neighborhood.  Next door to the place he saw a
sign:  "1000 chemises."  The shirts filled the window, piled,
cravated, stuffed, or draped with shoddy grace on the showcase
floor:  "1000 chemises"--count them!  On either side he read:
"Papeterie," "PÃ¢tisserie," "Solde," "RÃ©clame"--and Constance
Talmadge in "DÃ©jeuner de Soleil," and farther away there were more
sombre announcements:  "VÃªtements EcclÃ©siastiques," "DÃ©claration de
DÃ©cÃ¨s" and "Pompes FunÃ¨bres."  Life and death.

He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in his
life--it was out of line with everything that had preceded it--even
out of line with what effect he might hope to produce upon
Rosemary.  Rosemary saw him always as a model of correctness--his
presence walking around this block was an intrusion.  But Dick's
necessity of behaving as he did was a projection of some submerged
reality: he was compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirt-
sleeve fitting his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirt-
sleeve like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his
neck, his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small
briefcase like a dandy--just as another man once found it necessary
to stand in front of a church in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes.
Dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten, unshriven,
unexpurgated.



XXI


After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became
suddenly involved in a human contact.  It was just the sort of
thing that was likely to happen to him when he was in the mood of
not wanting to see any one.  So rigidly did he sometimes guard his
exposed self-consciousness that frequently he defeated his own
purposes; as an actor who underplays a part sets up a craning
forward, a stimulated emotional attention in an audience, and seems
to create in others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open.
Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our
pity--we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us
exercise the abstract function of pity.

So Dick might, himself, have analyzed the incident that ensued.  As
he paced the Rue des Saintes-Anges he was spoken to by a thin-faced
American, perhaps thirty, with an air of being scarred and a slight
but sinister smile.  As Dick gave him the light he requested, he
placed him as one of a type of which he had been conscious since
early youth--a type that loafed about tobacco stores with one elbow
on the counter and watched, through heaven knew what small chink of
the mind, the people who came in and out.  Intimate to garages,
where he had vague business conducted in undertones, to barber
shops, to the lobbies of theatres--in such places, at any rate,
Dick placed him.  Sometimes the face bobbed up in one of Tad's more
savage cartoons--in boyhood Dick had often thrown an uneasy glance
at the dim borderland of crime on which he stood.

"How do you like Paris, Buddy?"

Not waiting for an answer the man tried to fit in his footsteps
with Dick's:  "Where you from?" he asked encouragingly.

"From Buffalo."

"I'm from San Antone--but I been over here since the war."

"You in the army?"

"I'LL say I was.  Eighty-fourth Division--ever heard of that
outfit?"

The man walked a little ahead of him and fixed him with eyes that
were practically menacing.

"Staying in Paris awhile, Buddy?  Or just passing through."

"Passing through."

"What hotel you staying at?"

Dick had begun laughing to himself--the party had the intention of
rifling his room that night.  His thoughts were read apparently
without self-consciousness.

"With a build like yours you oughtn't to be afraid of me, Buddy.
There's a lot of bums around just laying for American tourists, but
you needn't be afraid of me."

Becoming bored, Dick stopped walking:  "I just wonder why you've
got so much time to waste."

"I'm in business here in Paris."

"In what line?"

"Selling papers."

The contrast between the formidable manner and the mild profession
was absurd--but the man amended it with:

"Don't worry; I made plenty money last year--ten or twenty francs
for a Sunny Times that cost six."

He produced a newspaper clipping from a rusty wallet and passed it
over to one who had become a fellow stroller--the cartoon showed a
stream of Americans pouring from the gangplank of a liner freighted
with gold.

"Two hundred thousand--spending ten million a summer."

"What you doing out here in Passy?"

His companion looked around cautiously.  "Movies," he said darkly.
"They got an American studio over there.  And they need guys can
speak English.  I'm waiting for a break."

Dick shook him off quickly and firmly.

It had become apparent that Rosemary either had escaped on one of
his early circuits of the block or else had left before he came
into the neighborhood; he went into the bistro on the corner,
bought a lead disk and, squeezed in an alcove between the kitchen
and the foul toilet, he called the Roi George.  He recognized
Cheyne-Stokes tendencies in his respiration--but like everything
the symptom served only to turn him in toward his emotion.  He gave
the number of the hotel; then stood holding the phone and staring
into the cafÃ©; after a long while a strange little voice said
hello.

"This is Dick--I had to call you."

A pause from her--then bravely, and in key with his emotion:  "I'm
glad you did."

"I came to meet you at your studio--I'm out in Passy across the way
from it.  I thought maybe we'd ride around through the Bois."

"Oh, I only stayed there a minute!  I'm so sorry."  A silence.

"Rosemary."

"Yes, Dick."

"Look, I'm in an extraordinary condition about you.  When a child
can disturb a middle-aged gent--things get difficult."

"You're not middle-aged, Dick--you're the youngest person in the
world."

"Rosemary?"  Silence while he stared at a shelf that held the
humbler poisons of France--bottles of Otard, Rhum St. James, Marie
Brizzard, Punch Orangeade, AndrÃ© Fernet Blanco, Cherry Rochet, and
Armagnac.

"Are you alone?"

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?

"Who do you think I'd be with?"

"That's the state I'm in.  I'd like to be with you now."

Silence, then a sigh and an answer.  "I wish you were with me now."

There was the hotel room where she lay behind a telephone number,
and little gusts of music wailed around her--


     "And two--for tea.
      And me for you,
      And you for me
      Alow-own."


There was the remembered dust of powder over her tan--when he
kissed her face it was damp around the corners of her hair; there
was the flash of a white face under his own, the arc of a shoulder.

"It's impossible," he said to himself.  In a minute he was out in
the street marching along toward the Muette, or away from it, his
small brief-case still in his hand, his gold-headed stick held at a
sword-like angle.

Rosemary returned to her desk and finished a letter to her mother.

"--I only saw him for a little while but I thought he was wonderful
looking.  I fell in love with him (Of course I Do Love Dick Best
but you know what I mean).  He really is going to direct the
picture and is leaving immediately for Hollywood, and I think we
ought to leave, too.  Collis Clay has been here.  I like him all
right but have not seen much of him because of the Divers, who
really are divine, about the Nicest People I ever Knew.  I am
feeling not very well to-day and am taking the Medicine, though see
No need for it.  I'm not even Going to Try to tell you All that's
Happened until I see YOU!!!  So when you get this letter WIRE,
WIRE, WIRE!  Are you coming north or shall I come south with the
Divers?"



At six Dick called Nicole.

"Have you any special plans?" he asked.  "Would you like to do
something quiet--dinner at the hotel and then a play?"

"Would you?  I'll do whatever you want.  I phoned Rosemary a while
ago and she's having dinner in her room.  I think this upset all of
us, don't you?"

"It didn't upset me," he objected.  "Darling, unless you're
physically tired let's do something.  Otherwise we'll get south and
spend a week wondering why we didn't see Boucher.  It's better than
brooding--"

This was a blunder and Nicole took him up sharply.

"Brooding about what?"

"About Maria Wallis."

She agreed to go to a play.  It was a tradition between them that
they should never be too tired for anything, and they found it made
the days better on the whole and put the evenings more in order.
When, inevitably, their spirits flagged they shifted the blame to
the weariness and fatigue of others.  Before they went out, as
fine-looking a couple as could be found in Paris, they knocked
softly at Rosemary's door.  There was no answer; judging that she
was asleep they walked into a warm strident Paris night, snatching
a vermouth and bitters in the shadow by Fouquet's bar.

Nicole awoke late, murmuring something back into her dream before
she parted her long lashes tangled with sleep.  Dick's bed was
empty--only after a minute did she realize that she had been
awakened by a knock at their salon door.

"Entrez!" she called, but there was no answer, and after a moment
she slipped on a dressing-gown and went to open it.  A sergent-de-
ville confronted her courteously and stepped inside the door.

"Mr. Afghan North--he is here?"

"What?  No--he's gone to America."

"When did he leave, Madame?"

"Yesterday morning."

He shook his head and waved his forefinger at her in a quicker
rhythm.

"He was in Paris last night.  He is registered here but his room is
not occupied.  They told me I had better ask at this room."

"Sounds very peculiar to me--we saw him off yesterday morning on
the boat train."

"Be that as it may, he has been seen here this morning.  Even his
carte d'identitÃ© has been seen.  And there you are."

"We know nothing about it," she proclaimed in amazement.

He considered.  He was an ill-smelling, handsome man.

"You were not with him at all last night?"

"But no."

"We have arrested a Negro.  We are convinced we have at last
arrested the correct Negro."

"I assure you that I haven't an idea what you're talking about.  If
it's the Mr. Abraham North, the one we know, well, if he was in
Paris last night we weren't aware of it."

The man nodded, sucked his upper lip, convinced but disappointed.

"What happened?" Nicole demanded.

He showed his palms, puffing out his closed mouth.  He had begun to
find her attractive and his eyes flickered at her.

"What do you wish, Madame?  A summer affair.  Mr. Afghan North was
robbed and he made a complaint.  We have arrested the miscreant.
Mr. Afghan should come to identify him and make the proper
charges."

Nicole pulled her dressing-gown closer around her and dismissed him
briskly.  Mystified she took a bath and dressed.  By this time it
was after ten and she called Rosemary but got no answer--then she
phoned the hotel office and found that Abe had indeed registered,
at six-thirty this morning.  His room, however, was still
unoccupied.  Hoping for a word from Dick she waited in the parlor
of the suite; just as she had given up and decided to go out, the
office called and announced:

"Meestaire Crawshow, un nÃ¨gre."

"On what business?" she demanded.

"He says he knows you and the doctaire.  He says there is a
Meestaire Freeman into prison that is a friend of all the world.
He says there is injustice and he wishes to see Meestaire North
before he himself is arrested."

"We know nothing about it."  Nicole disclaimed the whole business
with a vehement clap of the receiver.  Abe's bizarre reappearance
made it plain to her how fatigued she was with his dissipation.
Dismissing him from her mind she went out, ran into Rosemary at the
dressmaker's, and shopped with her for artificial flowers and all-
colored strings of colored beads on the Rue de Rivoli.  She helped
Rosemary choose a diamond for her mother, and some scarfs and novel
cigarette cases to take home to business associates in California.
For her son she bought Greek and Roman soldiers, a whole army of
them, costing over a thousand francs.  Once again they spent their
money in different ways and again Rosemary admired Nicole's method
of spending.  Nicole was sure that the money she spent was hers--
Rosemary still thought her money was miraculously lent to her and
she must consequently be very careful of it.

It was fun spending money in the sunlight of the foreign city with
healthy bodies under them that sent streams of color up to their
faces; with arms and hands, legs and ankles that they stretched out
confidently, reaching or stepping with the confidence of women
lovely to men.

When they got back to the hotel and found Dick, all bright and new
in the morning, both of them had a moment of complete childish joy.

He had just received a garbled telephone call from Abe who, so it
appeared, had spent the forenoon in hiding.

"It was one of the most extraordinary telephone conversations I've
ever held."

Dick had talked not only to Abe but to a dozen others.  On the
phone these supernumeraries had been typically introduced as: "--
man wants to talk to you is in the teput dome, well he says he was
in it--what is it?

"Hey, somebody, shut-up--anyhow, he was in some shandel-scandal and
he kaa POS-sibly go home.  My own PER-sonal is that--my personal is
he's had a--"  Gulps sounded and thereafter what the party had,
rested with the unknown.

The phone yielded up a supplementary offer:

"I thought it would appeal to you anyhow as a psychologist."  The
vague personality who corresponded to this statement was eventually
hung on to the phone; in the sequence he failed to appeal to Dick,
as a psychologist, or indeed as anything else.  Abe's conversation
flowed on as follows:

"Hello."

"Well?"

"Well, hello."

"Who are you?"

"Well."  There were interpolated snorts of laughter.

"Well, I'll put somebody else on the line."

Sometimes Dick could hear Abe's voice, accompanied by scufflings,
droppings of the receiver, far-away fragments such as, "No, I
don't, Mr. North. . . ."  Then a pert decided voice had said:  "If
you are a friend of Mr. North you will come down and take him
away."

Abe cut in, solemn and ponderous, beating it all down with an
overtone of earth-bound determination.

"Dick, I've launched a race riot in Montmartre.  I'm going over and
get Freeman out of jail.  If a Negro from Copenhagen that makes
shoe polish--hello, can you hear me--well, look, if anybody comes
there--"  Once again the receiver was a chorus of innumerable
melodies.

"Why you back in Paris?" Dick demanded.

"I got as far as Evreux, and I decided to take a plane back so I
could compare it with St. Sulpice.  I mean I don't intend to bring
St. Sulpice back to Paris.  I don't even mean Baroque!  I meant St.
Germain.  For God's sake, wait a minute and I'll put the chasseur
on the wire."

"For God's sake, don't."

"Listen--did Mary get off all right?"

"Yes."

"Dick, I want you to talk with a man I met here this morning, the
son of a naval officer that's been to every doctor in Europe.  Let
me tell you about him--"

Dick had rung off at this point--perhaps that was a piece of
ingratitude for he needed grist for the grinding activity of his
mind.

"Abe used to be so nice," Nicole told Rosemary.  "So nice.  Long
ago--when Dick and I were first married.  If you had known him
then.  He'd come to stay with us for weeks and weeks and we
scarcely knew he was in the house.  Sometimes he'd play--sometimes
he'd be in the library with a muted piano, making love to it by the
hour--Dick, do you remember that maid?  She thought he was a ghost
and sometimes Abe used to meet her in the hall and moo at her, and
it cost us a whole tea service once--but we didn't care."

So much fun--so long ago.  Rosemary envied them their fun,
imagining a life of leisure unlike her own.  She knew little of
leisure but she had the respect for it of those who have never had
it.  She thought of it as a resting, without realizing that the
Divers were as far from relaxing as she was herself.

"What did this to him?" she asked.  "Why does he have to drink?"

Nicole shook her head right and left, disclaiming responsibility
for the matter:  "So many smart men go to pieces nowadays."

"And when haven't they?" Dick asked.  "Smart men play close to the
line because they have to--some of them can't stand it, so they
quit."

"It must lie deeper than that."  Nicole clung to her conversation;
also she was irritated that Dick should contradict her before
Rosemary.  "Artists like--well, like Fernand don't seem to have to
wallow in alcohol.  Why is it just Americans who dissipate?"

There were so many answers to this question that Dick decided to
leave it in the air, to buzz victoriously in Nicole's ears.  He had
become intensely critical of her.  Though he thought she was the
most attractive human creature he had ever seen, though he got from
her everything he needed, he scented battle from afar, and
subconsciously he had been hardening and arming himself, hour
by hour.  He was not given to self-indulgence and he felt
comparatively graceless at this moment of indulging himself,
blinding his eyes with the hope that Nicole guessed at only an
emotional excitement about Rosemary.  He was not sure--last night
at the theatre she had referred pointedly to Rosemary as a child.

The trio lunched downstairs in an atmosphere of carpets and padded
waiters, who did not march at the stomping quick-step of those men
who brought good food to the tables whereon they had recently
dined.  Here there were families of Americans staring around at
families of Americans, and trying to make conversation with one
another.

There was a party at the next table that they could not account
for.  It consisted of an expansive, somewhat secretarial, would-
you-mind-repeating young man, and a score of women.  The women were
neither young nor old nor of any particular social class; yet the
party gave the impression of a unit, held more closely together for
example than a group of wives stalling through a professional
congress of their husbands.  Certainly it was more of a unit than
any conceivable tourist party.

An instinct made Dick suck back the grave derision that formed on
his tongue; he asked the waiter to find out who they were.

"Those are the gold-star muzzers," explained the waiter.

Aloud and in low voices they exclaimed.  Rosemary's eyes filled
with tears.

"Probably the young ones are the wives," said Nicole.

Over his wine Dick looked at them again; in their happy faces, the
dignity that surrounded and pervaded the party, he perceived all
the maturity of an older America.  For a while the sobered women
who had come to mourn for their dead, for something they could not
repair, made the room beautiful.  Momentarily, he sat again on his
father's knee, riding with Moseby while the old loyalties and
devotions fought on around him.  Almost with an effort he turned
back to his two women at the table and faced the whole new world in
which he believed.

--Do you mind if I pull down the curtain?


Abe North was still in the Ritz bar, where he had been since nine
in the morning.  When he arrived seeking sanctuary the windows were
open and great beams were busy at pulling up the dust from smoky
carpets and cushions.  Chasseurs tore through the corridors,
liberated and disembodied, moving for the moment in pure space.
The sit-down bar for women, across from the bar proper, seemed very
small--it was hard to imagine what throngs it could accommodate in
the afternoon.

The famous Paul, the concessionaire, had not arrived, but Claude,
who was checking stock, broke off his work with no improper
surprise to make Abe a pick-me-up.  Abe sat on a bench against a
wall.  After two drinks he began to feel better--so much better
that he mounted to the barber's shop and was shaved.  When he
returned to the bar Paul had arrived--in his custom-built motor,
from which he had disembarked correctly at the Boulevard des
Capucines.  Paul liked Abe and came over to talk.

"I was supposed to ship home this morning," Abe said.  "I mean
yesterday morning, or whatever this is."

"Why din you?" asked Paul.

Abe considered, and happened finally to a reason:  "I was reading a
serial in Liberty and the next installment was due here in Paris--
so if I'd sailed I'd have missed it--then I never would have read
it."

"It must be a very good story."

"It's a terr-r-rible story."

Paul arose chuckling and paused, leaning on the back of a chair:

"If you really want to get off, Mr. North, there are friends of
yours going to-morrow on the France--Mister what is this name--and
Slim Pearson.  Mister--I'll think of it--tall with a new beard."

"Yardly," Abe supplied.

"Mr. Yardly.  They're both going on the France."

He was on his way to his duties but Abe tried to detain him:  "If I
didn't have to go by way of Cherbourg.  The baggage went that way."

"Get your baggage in New York," said Paul, receding.

The logic of the suggestion fitted gradually into Abe's pitch--he
grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for, or rather of
prolonging his state of irresponsibility.

Other clients had meanwhile drifted in to the bar: first came a
huge Dane whom Abe had somewhere encountered.  The Dane took a seat
across the room, and Abe guessed he would be there all the day,
drinking, lunching, talking or reading newspapers.  He felt a
desire to out-stay him.  At eleven the college boys began to step
in, stepping gingerly lest they tear one another bag from bag.  It
was about then he had the chasseur telephone to the Divers; by the
time he was in touch with them he was in touch also with other
friends--and his hunch was to put them all on different phones at
once--the result was somewhat general.  From time to time his mind
reverted to the fact that he ought to go over and get Freeman out
of jail, but he shook off all facts as parts of the nightmare.

By one o'clock the bar was jammed; amidst the consequent mixture of
voices the staff of waiters functioned, pinning down their clients
to the facts of drink and money.

"That makes two stingers . . . and one more . . . two martinis and
one . . . nothing for you, Mr. Quarterly . . . that makes three
rounds.  That makes seventy-five francs, Mr. Quarterly.  Mr.
Schaeffer said he had this--you had the last . . . I can only do
what you say . . . thanks vera-much."

In the confusion Abe had lost his seat; now he stood gently swaying
and talking to some of the people with whom he had involved
himself.  A terrier ran a leash around his legs but Abe managed to
extricate himself without upsetting and became the recipient of
profuse apologies.  Presently he was invited to lunch, but
declined.  It was almost Briglith, he explained, and there was
something he had to do at Briglith.  A little later, with the
exquisite manners of the alcoholic that are like the manners of a
prisoner or a family servant, he said good-by to an acquaintance,
and turning around discovered that the bar's great moment was over
as precipitately as it had begun.

Across from him the Dane and his companions had ordered luncheon.
Abe did likewise but scarcely touched it.  Afterwards, he just sat,
happy to live in the past.  The drink made past happy things
contemporary with the present, as if they were still going on,
contemporary even with the future as if they were about to happen
again.

At four the chasseur approached him:

"You wish to see a colored fellow of the name Jules Peterson?"

"God!  How did he find me?"

"I didn't tell him you were present."

"Who did?"  Abe fell over his glasses but recovered himself.

"Says he's already been around to all the American bars and
hotels."

"Tell him I'm not here--"  As the chasseur turned away Abe asked:
"Can he come in here?"

"I'll find out."

Receiving the question Paul glanced over his shoulder; he shook his
head, then seeing Abe he came over.

"I'm sorry; I can't allow it."

Abe got himself up with an effort and went out to the Rue Cambon.

With his miniature leather brief-case in his hand Richard Diver
walked from the seventh arrondisement--where he left a note for
Maria Wallis signed "Dicole," the word with which he and Nicole had
signed communications in the first days of love--to his shirt-
makers where the clerks made a fuss over him out of proportion to
the money he spent.  Ashamed at promising so much to these poor
Englishmen, with his fine manners, his air of having the key to
security, ashamed of making a tailor shift an inch of silk on his
arm.  Afterward he went to the bar of the Crillon and drank a small
coffee and two fingers of gin.

As he entered the hotel the halls had seemed unnaturally bright;
when he left he realized that it was because it had already turned
dark outside.  It was a windy four-o'clock night with the leaves on
the Champs ÃlysÃ©es singing and failing, thin and wild.  Dick turned
down the Rue de Rivoli, walking two squares under the arcades to
his bank where there was mail.  Then he took a taxi and started up
the Champs ÃlysÃ©es through the first patter of rain, sitting alone
with his love.

Back at two o'clock in the Roi George corridor the beauty of Nicole
had been to the beauty of Rosemary as the beauty of Leonardo's girl
was to that of the girl of an illustrator.  Dick moved on through
the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions of many men inside
him and nothing simple that he could see.



Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of.  She
was now what is sometimes called a "little wild thing"--by twenty-
four full hours she was not yet unified and she was absorbed in
playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a picture puzzle--
counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off Dick, Nicole, her
mother, the director she met yesterday, like stops on a string of
beads.

When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the rain,
thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly Hills.
When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed and Godlike
as he had always been, as older people are to younger, rigid
and unmalleable.  Dick saw her with an inevitable sense of
disappointment.  It took him a moment to respond to the unguarded
sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to
suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower.  He was conscious of the
print of her wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.

"Miss Television," he said with a lightness he did not feel.  He
put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his stick
against the wall.  His chin dominated the lines of pain around his
mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the corner of his
eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.

"Come and sit on my lap close to me," he said softly, "and let me
see about your lovely mouth."

She came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed down
outside--drip--dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful cold
image she had created.

Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, her face
getting big as it came up to him; he had never seen anything so
dazzling as the quality of her skin, and since sometimes beauty
gives back the images of one's best thoughts he thought of his
responsibility about Nicole, and of the responsibility of her being
two doors down across the corridor.

"The rain's over," he said.  "Do you see the sun on the slate?"

Rosemary stood up and leaned down and said her most sincere thing
to him:

"Oh, we're such ACTORS--you and I."

She went to her dresser and the moment that she laid her comb flat
against her hair there was a slow persistent knocking at the door.

They were shocked motionless; the knock was repeated insistently,
and in the sudden realization that the door was not locked Rosemary
finished her hair with one stroke, nodded at Dick who had quickly
jerked the wrinkles out of the bed where they had been sitting, and
started for the door.  Dick said in quite a natural voice, not too
loud:

"--so if you don't feel up to going out, I'll tell Nicole and we'll
have a very quiet last evening."

The precautions were needless for the situation of the parties
outside the door was so harassed as to preclude any but the most
fleeting judgments on matters not pertinent to themselves.
Standing there was Abe, aged by several months in the last twenty-
four hours, and a very frightened, concerned colored man whom Abe
introduced as Mr. Peterson of Stockholm.

"He's in a terrible situation and it's my fault," said Abe.  "We
need some good advice."

"Come in our rooms," said Dick.

Abe insisted that Rosemary come too and they crossed the hall to
the Divers' suite.  Jules Peterson, a small, respectable Negro, on
the suave model that heels the Republican party in the border
States, followed.

It appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the early
morning dispute in Montparnasse; he had accompanied Abe to the
police station and supported his assertion that a thousand
franc note had been seized out of his hand by a Negro, whose
identification was one of the points of the case.  Abe and Jules
Peterson, accompanied by an agent of police, returned to the bistro
and too hastily identified as the criminal a Negro, who, so it was
established after an hour, had only entered the place after Abe
left.  The police had further complicated the situation by
arresting the prominent Negro restaurateur, Freeman, who had only
drifted through the alcoholic fog at a very early stage and then
vanished.  The true culprit, whose case, as reported by his
friends, was that he had merely commandeered a fifty-franc note to
pay for drinks that Abe had ordered, had only recently and in a
somewhat sinister rÃ´le, reappeared upon the scene.

In brief, Abe had succeeded in the space of an hour in entangling
himself with the personal lives, consciences, and emotions of one
Afro-European and three Afro-Americans inhabiting the French Latin
quarter.  The disentanglement was not even faintly in sight and the
day had passed in an atmosphere of unfamiliar Negro faces bobbing
up in unexpected places and around unexpected corners, and
insistent Negro voices on the phone.

In person, Abe had succeeded in evading all of them, save Jules
Peterson.  Peterson was rather in the position of the friendly
Indian who had helped a white.  The Negroes who suffered from the
betrayal were not so much after Abe as after Peterson, and Peterson
was very much after what protection he might get from Abe.

Up in Stockholm Peterson had failed as a small manufacturer of shoe
polish and now possessed only his formula and sufficient trade
tools to fill a small box; however, his new protector had promised
in the early hours to set him up in business in Versailles.  Abe's
former chauffeur was a shoemaker there and Abe had handed Peterson
two hundred francs on account.

Rosemary listened with distaste to this rigmarole; to appreciate
its grotesquerie required a more robust sense of humor than hers.
The little man with his portable manufactory, his insincere eyes
that, from time to time, rolled white semicircles of panic into
view; the figure of Abe, his face as blurred as the gaunt fine
lines of it would permit--all this was as remote from her as
sickness.

"I ask only a chance in life," said Peterson with the sort of
precise yet distorted intonation peculiar to colonial countries.
"My methods are simple, my formula is so good that I was drove away
from Stockholm, ruined, because I did not care to dispose of it."

Dick regarded him politely--interest formed, dissolved, he turned
to Abe:

"You go to some hotel and go to bed.  After you're all straight Mr.
Peterson will come and see you."

"But don't you appreciate the mess that Peterson's in?" Abe
protested.

"I shall wait in the hall," said Mr. Peterson with delicacy.  "It
is perhaps hard to discuss my problems in front of me."

He withdrew after a short travesty of a French bow; Abe pulled
himself to his feet with the deliberation of a locomotive.

"I don't seem highly popular to-day."

"Popular but not probable," Dick advised him.  "My advice is to
leave this hotel--by way of the bar, if you want.  Go to the
Chambord, or if you'll need a lot of service, go over to the
Majestic."

"Could I annoy you for a drink?"

"There's not a thing up here," Dick lied.

Resignedly Abe shook hands with Rosemary; he composed his face
slowly, holding her hand a long time and forming sentences that did
not emerge.

"You are the most--one of the most--"

She was sorry, and rather revolted at his dirty hands, but she
laughed in a well-bred way, as though it were nothing unusual to
her to watch a man walking in a slow dream.  Often people display a
curious respect for a man drunk, rather like the respect of simple
races for the insane.  Respect rather than fear.  There is
something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions, who
will do anything.  Of course we make him pay afterward for his
moment of superiority, his moment of impressiveness.  Abe turned to
Dick with a last appeal.

"If I go to a hotel and get all steamed and curry-combed, and sleep
awhile, and fight off these Senegalese--could I come and spend the
evening by the fireside?"

Dick nodded at him, less in agreement than in mockery and said:
"You have a high opinion of your current capacities."

"I bet if Nicole was here she'd let me come back."

"All right."  Dick went to a trunk tray and brought a box to the
central table; inside were innumerable cardboard letters.

"You can come if you want to play anagrams."

Abe eyed the contents of the box with physical revulsion, as though
he had been asked to eat them like oats.

"What are anagrams?  Haven't I had enough strange--"

"It's a quiet game.  You spell words with them--any word except
alcohol."

"I bet you can spell alcohol," Abe plunged his hand among the
counters.  "Can I come back if I can spell alcohol?"

"You can come back if you want to play anagrams."

Abe shook his head resignedly.

"If you're in that frame of mind there's no use--I'd just be in the
way."  He waved his finger reproachfully at Dick.  "But remember
what George the third said, that if Grant was drunk he wished he
would bite the other generals."

With a last desperate glance at Rosemary from the golden corners of
his eyes, he went out.  To his relief Peterson was no longer in the
corridor.  Feeling lost and homeless he went back to ask Paul the
name of that boat.


When he had tottered out, Dick and Rosemary embraced fleetingly.
There was a dust of Paris over both of them through which they
scented each other: the rubber guard on Dick's fountain pen, the
faintest odor of warmth from Rosemary's neck and shoulders.  For
another half-minute Dick clung to the situation; Rosemary was first
to return to reality.

"I must go, youngster," she said.

They blinked at each other across a widening space, and Rosemary
made an exit that she had learned young, and on which no director
had ever tried to improve.

She opened the door of her room and went directly to her desk where
she had suddenly remembered leaving her wristwatch.  It was there;
slipping it on she glanced down at the daily letter to her mother,
finishing the last sentence in her mind.  Then, rather gradually,
she realized without turning about that she was not alone in the
room.

In an inhabited room there are refracting objects only half
noticed: varnished wood, more or less polished brass, silver and
ivory, and beyond these a thousand conveyers of light and shadow so
mild that one scarcely thinks of them as that, the tops of picture-
frames, the edges of pencils or ash-trays, of crystal or china
ornaments; the totality of this refraction--appealing to equally
subtle reflexes of the vision as well as to those associational
fragments in the subconscious that we seem to hang on to, as a
glass-fitter keeps the irregularly shaped pieces that may do some
time--this fact might account for what Rosemary afterward
mystically described as "realizing" that there was some one in the
room, before she could determine it.  But when she did realize it
she turned swift in a sort of ballet step and saw that a dead Negro
was stretched upon her bed.

As she cried "aaouu!" and her still unfastened wristwatch banged
against the desk she had the preposterous idea that it was Abe
North.  Then she dashed for the door and across the hall.

Dick was straightening up; he had examined the gloves worn that day
and thrown them into a pile of soiled gloves in a corner of a
trunk.  He had hung up coat and vest and spread his shirt on
another hanger--a trick of his own.  "You'll wear a shirt that's a
little dirty where you won't wear a mussed shirt."  Nicole had come
in and was dumping one of Abe's extraordinary ash-trays into the
waste-basket when Rosemary tore into the room.

"DICK!  DICK!  Come and see!"

Dick jogged across the hall into her room.  He knelt to Peterson's
heart, and felt the pulse--the body was warm, the face, harassed
and indirect in life, was gross and bitter in death; the box of
materials was held under one arm but the shoe that dangled over the
bedside was bare of polish and its sole was worn through.  By
French law Dick had no right to touch the body but he moved the arm
a little to see something--there was a stain on the green coverlet,
there would be faint blood on the blanket beneath.

Dick closed the door and stood thinking; he heard cautious steps in
the corridor and then Nicole calling him by name.  Opening the door
he whispered:  "Bring the couverture and top blanket from one of
our beds--don't let any one see you."  Then, noticing the strained
look on her face, he added quickly, "Look here, you mustn't get
upset over this--it's only some nigger scrap."

"I want it to be over."

The body, as Dick lifted it, was light and ill-nourished.  He held
it so that further hemorrhages from the wound would flow into the
man's clothes.  Laying it beside the bed he stripped off the
coverlet and top blanket and then opening the door an inch,
listened--there was a clank of dishes down the hall followed by a
loud patronizing "Mer-CI, Madame," but the waiter went in the other
direction, toward the service stairway.  Quickly Dick and Nicole
exchanged bundles across the corridor; after spreading this
covering on Rosemary's bed, Dick stood sweating in the warm
twilight, considering.  Certain points had become apparent to him
in the moment following his examination of the body; first, that
Abe's first hostile Indian had tracked the friendly Indian and
discovered him in the corridor, and when the latter had taken
desperate refuge in Rosemary's room, had hunted down and slain him;
second, that if the situation were allowed to develop naturally, no
power on earth could keep the smear off Rosemary--the paint was
scarcely dry on the Arbuckle case.  Her contract was contingent
upon an obligation to continue rigidly and unexceptionally as
"Daddy's Girl."

Automatically Dick made the old motion of turning up his sleeves
though he wore a sleeveless undershirt, and bent over the body.
Getting a purchase on the shoulders of the coat he kicked open the
door with his heel, and dragged the body quickly into a plausible
position in the corridor.  He came back into Rosemary's room and
smoothed back the grain of the plush floor rug.  Then he went to
the phone in his suite and called the manager-owner of the hotel.

"McBeth?--it's Doctor Diver speaking--something very important.
Are we on a more or less private line?"

It was good that he had made the extra effort which had firmly
entrenched him with Mr. McBeth.  Here was one use for all the
pleasingness that Dick had expended over a large area he would
never retrace. . . .

"Going out of the suite we came on a dead Negro . . . in the hall
. . . no, no, he's a civilian.  Wait a minute now--I knew you didn't
want any guests to blunder on the body so I'm phoning you.  Of
course I must ask you to keep my name out of it.  I don't want any
French red tape just because I discovered the man."

What exquisite consideration for the hotel!  Only because Mr.
McBeth, with his own eyes, had seen these traits in Doctor Diver
two nights before, could he credit the story without question.

In a minute Mr. McBeth arrived and in another minute he was joined
by a gendarme.  In the interval he found time to whisper to Dick,
"You can be sure the name of any guest will be protected.  I'm only
too grateful to you for your pains."

Mr. McBeth took an immediate step that may only be imagined, but
that influenced the gendarme so as to make him pull his mustaches
in a frenzy of uneasiness and greed.  He made perfunctory notes and
sent a telephone call to his post.  Meanwhile with a celerity that
Jules Peterson, as a business man, would have quite understood, the
remains were carried into another apartment of one of the most
fashionable hotels in the world.

Dick went back to his salon.

"What HAP-pened?" cried Rosemary.  "Do all the Americans in Paris
just shoot at each other all the time?"

"This seems to be the open season," he answered.  "Where's Nicole?"

"I think she's in the bathroom."

She adored him for saving her--disasters that could have attended
upon the event had passed in prophecy through her mind; and she had
listened in wild worship to his strong, sure, polite voice making
it all right.  But before she reached him in a sway of soul and
body his attention focussed on something else: he went into the
bedroom and toward the bathroom.  And now Rosemary, too, could
hear, louder and louder, a verbal inhumanity that penetrated the
keyholes and the cracks in the doors, swept into the suite and in
the shape of horror took form again.

With the idea that Nicole had fallen in the bathroom and hurt
herself, Rosemary followed Dick.  That was not the condition of
affairs at which she stared before Dick shouldered her back and
brusquely blocked her view.

Nicole knelt beside the tub swaying sidewise and sidewise.  "It's
you!" she cried, "--it's you come to intrude on the only privacy I
have in the world--with your spread with red blood on it.  I'll
wear it for you--I'm not ashamed, though it was such a pity.  On
All Fools Day we had a party on the Zurichsee, and all the fools
were there, and I wanted to come dressed in a spread but they
wouldn't let me--"

"Control yourself!"

"--so I sat in the bathroom and they brought me a domino and said
wear that.  I did.  What else could I do?"

"Control yourself, Nicole!"

"I never expected you to love me--it was too late--only don't come
in the bathroom, the only place I can go for privacy, dragging
spreads with red blood on them and asking me to fix them."

"Control yourself.  Get up--"

Rosemary, back in the salon, heard the bathroom door bang, and
stood trembling: now she knew what Violet McKisco had seen in the
bathroom at Villa Diana.  She answered the ringing phone and almost
cried with relief when she found it was Collis Clay, who had traced
her to the Divers' apartment.  She asked him to come up while she
got her hat, because she was afraid to go into her room alone.
